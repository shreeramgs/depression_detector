19970	Crypto and US Politics: Is Bipartisan Regulation Possible? $GHC #GalaxyHeroes https://t.co/W5QLrpZPdf
19971	@jeremycorbyn 99% of politicians are in it for themselves.Make it law-no politician allowed to have shares in essential companies; it‚Äôs a conflict of interest.  Ban Donors, they want a return. The amount of corruption going on is outrageous. The country need transparency in politics.
19972	@gilmored85 i think your point is logical/right but politics will require going thru the crisis -- scotus asserting unaccountable dominance over voters and legislatures -- before ppl are open to any of the radical/necessary solutions
19973	@KryptekSR The focus remains the same as always: to optimize the game and go as fast as possible! The difference is the cohesiveness and organization that goes into maintaining big healthy leaderboards, and the politics and compromise that are inherently a part of doing that the right way.
19974	"Seeing people on Twitter talk about Canadian politics is hilarious. I kinda want to encourage them to push for their want, just because it will bring about, in their words ""Their worst nightmare"". 

We need more civics education lol"
19975	@MeidasTouch The difference between BoJo leaving and Trump getting impeached? The Hobby Lobby ruling. The money in US politics that lead to absurd positions, defying the will of the people and supporting amoral behavior all fueled by corporate dollars who are 'people too' make us special
19976	"ICYMI in #PApol ‚û°Ô∏è ""Pennsylvania GOP luminaries, including two former congressmen, a former lieutenant governor and a former state House speaker"" have joined #TeamShapiro ‚Äî because Pennsylvanians across politics know @JoshShapiroPA is the Governor we need. https://t.co/pqWtJdKKfQ"
19977	@jeremycorbyn Real change will not come from party politics. The West needs a profound revolution.
19978	@nc4luvrus @kopboy07 But they needed to coordinate amd cooperate with SNP and Jo Swinson who wasn't playing ball.British politics doesn't favour collaboration for a joint goal. It's too focused on adversity and differences.
19979	"I've got politics on the TV, show scores being updated on my laptop, and next door's pooch asleep at my feet.

It won't get any better than this.  ‚öñÔ∏èüé∂üê∂ #Happy"
19980	OK ENOUGH OF CHENEY‚ÄºÔ∏èSHE MUST BE RAN OUT OF POLITICS‚ÄºÔ∏è https://t.co/07M5wQgWoe
19981	@returnofbex @BennieGThompson There are questions around politics, politicians and political events on jeopardy all the time. I don‚Äôt know why people are so bent out of shape.
19982	We can choose freedom over fear, country over party &amp; people over politics by electing people like @JoshShapiroPA who want to improve our country, not those who will do anything to make sure their side wins  by overturning election results they don't like.
19983	@YourAnonNews Does this mean there will be less Russian influence in British politics? One can hope.

19987	@Baddiel His politics were left too.
19988	@guyverhofstadt Please keep your nose out of the UK's politics. We are not part of your empire and have no desire to be; especially as you are bankrolling Putin's War Machine and undermining NATO.
19989	@ReginaAgno @mlq3 Tingin nla kc sa marcoses mga walang pera bago nag politics si the late fem. They don't know the history na wealthy naman na sila tlaga, even the romualdezes. Plus ung mga gold ni fem na ininvest nila, murang mura nakuha, then sobra laki appreciation ng value. Hay.
19990	@gmbutts Gerry. You f****d up federal politics. Stay away from Alberta. We neither need or want you.
19991	A minor assignment advising those who will succeed you can have more satisfactory results. I have a conviction of about 79% that in politics equals 100%. https://t.co/jiMiR1I0G1
19992	@renoomokri Why divert from playing divisive politics. Enjoy your account while it last.. Evil in human form, you want to incite the northerners against PO but you have failed woefully!
19993	I have to agree that this is up there as being the funniest sign off in politics, I can't believe he said it üòÇüòÇ https://t.co/UOI0YpH2jn
19994	Uhh anyways, electoral politics posting has stopped me from Ewyposting. I‚Äôve been listening to Modern Day Guy Fawkes and Practise Room 3 a ridiculous amount since Tuesday at 6pm. That‚Äôs all I have to say, in all honesty.
19995	Time to log on and discuss UK politics https://t.co/cLVPWzhENc
19996	@timothy_stanley Do you care about integrity in politics at all?
19997	@MasonTBecker Why don‚Äôt we hire someone to be sheriff. Submit a resume, go through the interviews, best candidate serves as sheriff. Too much politics inserted needlessly into what shouldn‚Äôt be political at all.

19999	@joelmmathis I hate Ron DeSantis' politics but I just got back from a vacation in Florida because it's beautiful and Disney is awesome.  What a stupid statementü§£  If anything, good on him for visiting a state who he would disagree with politically!  That's bi-partisan!
