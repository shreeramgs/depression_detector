3231	my two cents is that ‚Äúbad‚Äù does not really mean anything and ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù is a rare quality. i think if you see movies purely as entertainment then anonymity is a forgivable trait; if you‚Äôre interested in film as an art form you put a premium on peculiarity of vision. https://t.co/TVShRoy5Wf
