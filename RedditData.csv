4,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.,e8gjky,Fantastic-Profession,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e8gjky/raped_in_front_of_my_girlfriend_feeling_like/,2821,SuicideWatch,False," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you."

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

edit: 
yes, I totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship, any type of relationship, starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better, then they simply do not care for the person. I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as, like I said in the og post, I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff, I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time."

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.

Edit: Wow I can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. I'll try to reply when I can. It's comforting to know we're in this together. Thanks for the encouragement everyone. It actually brightened my day a little. And please please don't hurt urselves. One thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is EMDR therapy.

But of course I couldn't just up and die. Christmas was around the corner, and I had so much shit to wrap, so many appetizers and cookies to make. Plus dying before Christmas is kinda rude. Death doesn't make for good dinner conversation. So I didn't die.

And now it's after Christmas, but I still can't die. I have an Amazon order for my stepdad's retirement dinner. It's just a $8 coffee mug, but I have to wait for it to arrive so I can fill it with jelly beans and give it to him this weekend.

Then the weekend after that is my brother's 21 birthday. Sure as fuck can't die before that. What a shitty way to spend your 21st birthday. And the weekend AFTER THAT my other brother and sister (the twins) are turning 18. I planned on making my sister some cute jewelry, so I still really don't have time to die if I actually intend on getting that made.

And then it'll be my birthday. The big 3-0.
Thirty years of being, well, me.
Thirty years of waking up each morning, stumbling through the menial tasks of living, the mundane gruntwork of keeping body and soul together, of maintaining healthy relationships, of planning for the future, of eating, breathing, shitting, and going to sleep each night.
Thirty years of fuck-all. 

But I can't die today. I have to pick up orange juice and bread from the store after work. There's still laundry to do. The dishes are still soaking in the sink. And my Amazon package hasn't arrived yet.


EDIT: Y'all have been wildly supportive, and I just want to say that I'm grateful for all of the people in this sub who are willing and able to be vulnerable about their mental states. It often feels like drowning in deep water, and I'm glad that everyone here today is still fighting the undertow. Keep treading. Grab onto any lifeline you can find.

I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, things don’t feel the same as they did when we were best friends. I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed. It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 3 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

• • • • •

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

So I brought her inside and fed her. 3 cans of tuna later, she's still hungry and breathing kinda weird, but I'm allergic so I brought her back outside with a tuna can for the road...tonight I was also trying to work up the strength to end it all, when the cat shows up again, but can't eat and breathing is worse. So now I've taken her to an emergency vet and have no idea how long I'll be here, but my plans have been foiled. Goddam cat has no idea what she's done. 

For the record, vet said she's fine, just hungry, so I guess I've got a new neighbor.

Update: she's back in her parking lot where I found her with an extra big of tuna and water, and I know nothing about cats because apparently her ""breathing problem"" was non-stop purring.

Update 2: I'm alive, and a few weeks later the cat is staying with us for the time being until a foster or adopter shows up. Her name is Summer and she loves being part of the family.

Update 3: 5mo later, she follows us on our walks and loves our dog. I'm doing much better now and am going back to school in 4 weeks. Thanks for the love!

Update (10/2/21): Summer spent a wonderful winter with us! She made things brighter and happier. I knew I was slightly allergic all along, but it got so bad that my Dr finally said I couldn't have the cat in the house. This was a while ago, and my throat has permanent scarring from the constant irritation. Summer needs to be with people, so I made the very difficult decision to get her to a rescue group, and I'm glad I did! She was apparently pregnant (I'd thought she was spayed) and her babies were safe and cared for and all of them got fixed and are now ready for adoption. I got to reunite with Summer at the adoption center this last week and she was so excited to see me! Heartbreaking ending, but she helped save my life, and I was able to thank her for that. I'm doing great, my Dr said technically my depression is in full remission! Thank you, Summer."

My point is that it’s frustrating that wanting to die has become the punchline to half of the jokes on the internet, so even when you’re trying to talk about being suicidal in a serious manner, people treat you as if you’re kidding. 

I also understand that absolutely no one’s obligated to listen to me. I always make sure that my friends are okay with me venting to them before I say anything even remotely emotional. If they’re not, I totally understand and they have every right to ignore me or tell me that they don’t feel comfortable with that. But responding to my “I’m struggling really bad right now” with a laugh and a joke is hurtful and unnecessary.

I also know that people might joke but actually be serious and coping through humour, but there’s just no need to turn what could be a meaningful conversation into a joke. If I come to someone about something and they respond with “I feel that way too, I’m sorry,” that’s absolutely valid. I have no issue at all with that. Just please don’t laugh at me. 

Anyways, hope you all have a great day. Keep fighting."

(made me smile) it feels horrible though when your plan doesn’t succeed and instead you have to deal with the consequences. i really don’t feel like attending school, or doing anything right now. i’m not going to lie, i do feel a bit better after my attempt (emotionally, not physically, i’m still in a bit of discomfort and pain) i do think i’m getting my medicine dosage higher. my friends probably didn’t even notice my absence, i wish i could tell someone how much i’m struggling. but it’s not like i could just pour all this information on someone who has no clue about this... it’s just horrible. i’m just going to sleep off the dreadful feelings. anyone thinking of drinking bleach 0/10 dont recommend, you will feel horrible."

I would use a hotline but I don’t want police coming to my house. I’m scared. I’m the most scared I’ve been in my life. 





I know nobody will read this, but here I want to tell my story. The truth is, I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go.

I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry, please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry."
56,"People always say; ""just"" get a job, ""just"" find a new hobby, ""just"" go for a walk, ""just"" make new friends. Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.",cgus30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cgus30/people_always_say_just_get_a_job_just_find_a_new/,1514,SuicideWatch,False,"Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

65,“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” I hate sayings like this with all my heart.,hhpzqn,herry720,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hhpzqn/suicide_is_a_permanent_solution_to_a_temporary/,1478,SuicideWatch,False,"People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

If people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

Do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

Although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain."

I didn't want to do it in my room because in a way I didn't want to defile it? I don't know how to explain it. 
My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved.

That has not been my experience.

I tried to hang myself last month. There was no apparent trigger, and I really wasn't thinking about much: no friend/family, no lover, no pet, no future. I was just glad to finally get out, and vaguely confused why I hadn't done it sooner. Within minutes I tied a noose, stepped on top of a box, put my head through the noose, and knocked the box over. I was not sad: I was just calm, and relieved for the first time in many years.

I don't remember what happened immediately after (must have passed out), but I woke up lying on my back, part of the noose still stuck around my neck. Apparently the rope snapped after I lost consciousness.

I remember being overcome by a deep sense of disappointment. When I looked into the mirror my face looked horrible, all purple (almost black) and swollen. I knew I had every reason to be scared, but I felt nothing.

It's been a month, and I thought about doing it again-doing it right-every day. I did not feel lucky that I survived. Instead, during the past month, there were countless times I thought: ""I wouldn't have to be doing this if I were dead.""

I know I'm going through a difficult phase in life. I know things \*might\* get better. But I'm just... disinterested. All these good things life has to offer seem so out of reach, and so abstract that I feel no craving for them. I'm so so exhausted, yet nobody in this world would accept me for just existing. Living has become a chore, a resistance to the temptation of death, while I'm not even sure what's the point.

Then he has the fucking audacity to say ""You doN't waNt To WORk aT MCDONald's For THe reSt Of yOUr LfFe dO YoU?""  I got so fucking pissed off. I was yelling at him trying to explaining why college isn't for me. And the last thing he says to me is ""I'm very disappointed in you Danny."" Go fuck yourself dad.

The other day my mom invited her friend over. They were sitting in the kitchen drinking wine, nothing unusual. I'm on the stairs eavesdropping as I hear my mom's friend mentioning her daughter's plans for college. She's gotten scholarships, applied to many different schools, scored pretty well on the SAT, and wants to major in Nursing. And my mom's response? ""I wish my son could be like that.""

I want to fucking run away. I hate my fucking parents. I can't believe there are people out there with actual supportive parents. If you've got supportive parents and you love them, and you can talk to them about anything, you don't realize how insanely privileged you are. I'd give up an arm and leg to have your parents. Instead, I had to be born to a shitty Korean American family that doesn't give a flying fuck about anything except for school. I'd rather fucking die than live with my shitty family any longer.

i don’t want to be here, i’m only here because i don’t want to ruin the lives of the people who care for me. sometimes i think that i can just continue to live on despite being miserable for the sake of other people’s happiness, but i’m not sure whether i’m going to make it. almost every thought i have eventually loops back to suicide, no matter how happy the initial thought. 

i’ve made a plan to stick it out until my siblings finish their exams. after that i’m pretty sure i’m going to kill myself. 

sorry for the morbid and depressing post, i used to be a lot of fun."

I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Mental health support reminds me of this post I saw a year or so ago:

>That's the thing about any of these people they get to talk to you; therapists, counselors, any of them. There is a limit to how much of your issues you're allowed to show before you're deemed out of hand. They can handle the conventional issues that they were taught in Psych 1 but anything beyond that gets you thrown in a mental cell and a combination of pills shoved down your throat.

>The simple truth is that if you are born different, you are fucked. Your life will be one of exclusion, sadness, loneliness, and not having a place to belong. There are simply no resources for those on the fringe, because the world was built for the majority."

After the treatment, the tumor was removed and he had other complications afterwards which were resolved over Christmas. But he came back weakened and underweight from the hospital. Then he we got infected with Covid-19. Today he was picked up by an ambulance, because he got weaker and weaker. When I spoke with the Doctor over the phoned, he mentioned that the cancer has spread and that they can only stop its spreading even further - something my Dad kept secret from me. It all makes sense now. He suddenly started buying me expensive presents, despite me not wanting them, stopped talking about next Christmas and suddenly mentioning back up plans and so on. Even the thought alone makes me want to rip out my heart, as the pain is paralysing my body and mind. I dont want to be alone. I no longer have friends. My Aunt is old and sick aswell. My Uncle just died of Covid. Why is everyone dying in my family. I cant anymore. My family is small and taken so fast.

This is it. When he dies I will kill myself as I am about to be alone and that thought freightens me. Only my memories will remain of a happier time and even those a fading. Maybe then I will see my Mother again. Maybe then we will be a happy family again. I am living in the past anyway."

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end."

I couldn’t forgive but because i already had depression and knew that i decided to start taking medication because I have never cared about any one or thing half as much as I cared about her.

By December we had both tried to take our lives multiple times and after she found me overdosed in our apartment she promised me she wouldn’t kill herself so I promised i wouldn’t try again. But she had to travel for work and found out she was pregnant while away. 

She immediately canceled the trip and came home to have an abortion but got quarantined and i don’t even remember how many days into quarantine before we had an argument and i wasn’t staying there because i needed to be able to bring her food, the last thing my reason for living said was she wasn’t going to mill herself but wanted to sleep, i said ok. Then she wouldn’t respond realized she was in a dark place and went there as fast as i could but in 20 minutes she had died.

I gave her cpr and called everyone who could help hoping i could save her but felt her body go cold under my hands but i was stupid and hopeful i couldn’t be anything else in the moment, the paramedics got her heart started but she was gone already, i didn’t know and spent the next two nights sleeping in the lobby waiting for news then got told harshly by a nurse who didn’t know that I didn’t know she was legally dead already and i tried hitting my head into a wall to die but all i got was a split skull and a dislocated wrist. Was under suicide watch for a time was there when my wife passed but am not on such tight suicide watch anymore and am trying not to care about how everyone else feels but just kill my self.

i dont know if I should before or after her funeral.


Add on, the last thing her parents said was I killed her and that i hurt her memory by living as a liar saying i was ever good to her. I made videos for my family and friends to explain I don’t want them to be blamed, i have a lot of benzodiazepines left from being in the hospital, and got a bottle of vodka.

I appreciate the kindness and love but mine isn’t a case of wanting people to stop me, and a friend told me that funerals are for the living not the dead so I don’t have to wait"
114,Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,d2370x,SQLwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d2370x/reminder_absolutely_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,1214,SuicideWatch,False,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair."

I can't...

I started crying. I grabbed him and hugged him. Everytime I look at him, I think ""who will feed him if I'm not here? He would die"", ""I'm the only one who cares about him (my parents don't)"".

I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.


EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS MY INBOX IS GETTING FLOODED WITH SUPPORT, SILVERS AND A PLATINUM. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT. I NEVER FELT LOVED LIKE THIS BEFORE. TO ALL WHO MESSAGED ME SAYING THAT THEY ARE GLAD THAT I’M STILL HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED ON THIS POST. I CAN’T REPLY TO YOU ALL ONE BY ONE BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMMA LET MY DOG KNOW THAT HE GOT SO MUCH RECOGNITION FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD BOI. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRANGERS WHO MADE ME FELT THAT THEY LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️"

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place."

My speech at this point is calm, almost robotic. I get overly polite around authorities because of deep psychological issues. They check me, vital organs are fine. I’m alive. Everyone leaves the room except for the kind paramedic who was taking my blood pressure. He asked me if I was lying, because I swore up and down it was an accident. I told him the truth. About my sexual violations, and my issues with self worth, and my father and brother. I told him how I didn’t want to die deep down. I wish I did. That would make things easy. They left and my mom cried like never before. She told me i’m her only child, she won’t get another chance. That’s when everything hit me. It was like a new chance. A fresh slate.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife.

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂"

I'm 24 my mom is 47, the cancer is winning, it's over. 

Her doctor said she has 2 months to live.
I never thought that this day would ever come, i have so many regrets in life, the things i could've done but never ended up doing... it's all coming back to me now.. all the good times i had with my mom when i was younger, the times we went to the beach,the playground..every single bad thing i ever said to her is just excruciatingly painful now, ranging from even the smallest of things, how i always laughed at her baking skills, all the times i ignored her or yelled back at her.. i just wanna hug her and never let go.
If i could go back in time i would change everything, i would hug her, tell her how much i love her every single night and spend so much more time with her. I took everything for granted, and now i can't do anything to change that.

She means everything to me, she's the only person that's always been there for me, the only person that always belived in me.
Nothing could have prepared me for this moment, that constant gut wrenching feeling i have knowing full well it's gonna happen soon, and there is nothing i can do about it.

My sleeping schedule is all messed up, every night begins with me crying then calming down and then crying again, i wish i could just take her place.

I'm doing everything i can to make her as happy as possible, i wanna talk to her for hours but she can't, i don't even care about what we talk about i just wanna cherish every single second i have left with her.

Being there with her feels like a blessing and a curse, the pain never goes away.. but she's still here with me she's still alive, hearing her voice and telling her how much i love her feels so special ...but i feel like i'm not doing enough.. something is always missing.
I can't imagine my life without her.
The thought of never seeing her again, i won't be able to talk to her, i won't be able to visit her or expect any calls from her. She would just be gone. 


I can't even begin to describe this feeling.
Cherish what you have before it's gone, spend time with your friends and family and never be ashamed to tell them just how much you love them."

I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.

Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh.

He told me, but to swallow his price and tell others means so much to me. 

Update 1

I just got his name tattooed on my ring finger. We always talked about doing it, but never did. 

TRIGGER 

I so badly want to die. I found my husband dead Christmas Day. He shot himself in the head. They dragged me off his body. I called his mom to let her know and his family came and accused me of killing him to my face. 

I didn’t shoot him, but he did it bc of me. I spent all day Christmas with his blood still on me. I don’t know what is worse, being dragged off of him or being accused of killing this man I loved so deeply.

That was my 8th inpatient hospitalization for the same reason.
I was really suicidal. I still kind of am, just not as strongly as I was then. I've tried to move on and not attempt again. I haven't told anyone I'm feeling this way again because I don't want them to think negatively of me again. I'm so tired of being alone.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too.

My soulmate doesn't exist. Nobody is coming to save me. Nobody gives a shit. There is no meaning. There is no purpose. The universe was a mistake.

So. Friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. Beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that I'm not privy to. This set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

When they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. They took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. A state away. And we can't go see her. 

I am at a loss. I. Don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. Or even what I want by telling said story. I just. 

I almost lost my sister. I was *this* close and had no idea. None. I hate this feeling. And I can't even go to her. I don't know. I don't know where to go, or what to think.

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Everytime I needed you, you were there. You never complained about the time. You let me cry, shout, rage when I was in pain. You helped me so much. But you never told that you were in pain. Why?? Why didn't you??

Did you not think that I'd do everything to comfort you. I may not have been able to take away your pain, but I would've held your hand through it. 

I hate you. and I'll always hate you. Because I love you. and I'll always love you. 

No one can take your place. You were entirely special. All that sickening positivity and patience. Was it all a lie then? A mask? A cover-up for your feelings?

I'm sorry I failed you. I should've looked deeper. Should've been a better friend. May be if I didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. Is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?

I hate you and I'll always will. And someday I'm going to die as well. It may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. I'm going to die and then I'm going to find you in the afterlife. And I'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and God knows what else. But I'll never let you go then. I'll always, always be with you.

backstory: throughout the ages of 7-10 my sister was physically and sexually violent towards me. she used to cut me in my pubic area, till i was bleeding for days. shed hit me almost every day and she would tell me i am useless (etc...). whenever i told my mom about the things she did, she never tried helping me. throughout the years, i asked her why she never stopped it, she called me a liar at times, but also said she doesnt recall any of it happening

due to being stuck at home (lockdown), these memories came back up, and i realized that it was child abuse. i am 16 years old now. i have been seeing a therapist eversince i was 12 because i once 'tried' to commit suicide.

today my mother asked me if i am getting my sister anything for her birthday, i said no, and my mother asked me why im not going to do that. i told her that i do not support an abuser, and then i brought up the cutting that she did. and i asked her once again why she never did anything about it. she stayed silent this time, but said she was going to ask my sister about it because she doesnt remember it.

i am at my lowest, i am afraid that my sister is going to get violent towards me once again, if my mom asks her. my sister still lives with us."

I’ve been locked away alone for 4 years now, I have nobody, I really mean 0 people in my life. Pure isolation for years. I watch as human life unfolds and evolves beyond my walls, through a screen or from my window. I’m completely separated from humanity, it really gives you an odd perspective of the irrational nature of humans. 

There’s no future, there’s no present. There’s only time, infinite time, it feels surreal, it feels like death. I do not feel human but rather something akin to a ghost, in a purgatory. Every morning I’m woken to physical pain and when I’m conscious I am suddenly flooded with darkness with that realisation. The cycle never stops repeating, over and over. I know there’s beauty in this world, I know there’s fleeting glimpses of joy to be had but if by some sheer chance they’re found then those moments are almost completely muted from the passing of time. It’s as if that’s my only orientation of time now. 

Is what I’m experiencing actually really life? I can’t help but feel everyone else on earth is in some lower state of consciousness and acting out their life on autopilot and not knowing so. If I attempt to reach out there is never connection, so I’ve just given up. Their perspective is blind to my reality as mine is to theirs. A parody really, fall off and become isolated, attempt to rectify it and you’ve furthered your alienation. I hate every second that I’m aware of the passage of time."

Stared at the ceiling, slept again, woke up again and stared at the ceiling for a while once more. Took a thick cloth belt from the closet, tied one end around the bookshelf, put the loop around my neck. 

First thing I noticed was the pressure. My face felt like it was pulsing and expanding, like I could feel myself turning red. Then a loud ringing in my ears drowning out everything else. Then choking and sputtering as I breathed in and couldn’t. Arms and legs spasmed, took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt. Twice I tried to die, but both times I couldn't help but struggle to ease the belt off my neck. Strangling myself made my being alive feel so much more immediate, which was nauseating compared to the dissociative sad stasis preceding my decision to die. Which is ironic because I had previously believed I'd want to be conscious when I die, but it would be so much easier to just slip away silently in my sleep or something. I now have petechial hemorrhage all over my face, and some on my neck. My throat perpetually feels like it has a lump in it. I have a persistent bad headache, nausea, I feel like I can't think more than one looping thought per minute, I can barely focus on any coherent train of thought nor input from the physical world. It has taken me hours to write this. Honestly, not a good time. 

This is not the first time I've tried to kill myself and frankly, I am seriously worried it won't be the last. Somehow I feel both like I want to end my life and also like I don't, and in those fleeting moments of unsuicidal lucidity (madness?) I try to find ways to save or at least prevent myself from what I might do. I've heard that stuff about people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge saying right after they jumped they realized all their problems were solvable and they shouldn't have jumped, but for me that wasn't really the case. After the second try didn't succeed I kinda just sat there for a while feeling nothing. It was oddly soothing, feeling totally blank when usually my mind and emotions spiral incessantly in a depressive pattern. I wasn't relieved to be alive, I felt no new resolve to live my life to the fullest or even at all, and most of all, the things that made me want to die are just as present and real as they were before I strung the belt around my neck. In fact, the biggest thing that made me decide to die feels itself immortal and unkillable:

Evil. The world is evil, pervasively and ubiquitously so. I have been on the receiving end of it in more ways and more times than I care to remember, and I know I've contributed to it through my own thoughts and actions. Yes there is beauty and love and joy in the world, and such things are real and important, but in my experience they are fickle and pale in comparison to the omnipotent, omnipresent capacity of human evil. They don't make life worthwhile to me, and it follows that I don't feel as though life is inherently worthwhile either. To find happiness is fortunate and fleeting, because evil is the backdrop, the default. You are guaranteed to find evil, and you never need to look far.

Since I was a child, I would cry for hours on end, heartbroken at the suffering and horror caused by the evil humans do to each other. Why do people suffer, and make others suffer? How can such a world, and a life in such a world be worthwhile? I am 25 now and in that regard, I haven't changed much at all. If anything, it's more unbearable now. I have searched my entire life for something to make it make sense. I've read novels and poetry, I've read and listened to various religious and spiritual teachings, I spent years studying philosophy, I've listened to and made music, I've seen and made art, I've talked to people who seem able to cope, desperately trying to find something to redeem this shithole of a world. And I'm still as empty handed as I was years ago, but it feels worse now because I'm surrounded by failed explanations and justifications and it feels like I've run out of new ones to consider. Being surrounded by the husks of failed answers to that eternal, painful question feels somehow more desolate than being in a void of none.

Frankly, I don't want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic, broken darkness of the human soul. It feels maudlin and perhaps naive to say that the bottomless evil of humanity is what made me decide to take my life, but it's the honest reason. And it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The final words of Nicolas Chamfort in his suicide note have always resonated with me: ""And so I leave this world, where the heart must either break or turn to lead."" 

Right now, I don't want to try and kill myself again. But I don't know what to do to make sure that doesn't happen. I don't know that I won't attempt it again tomorrow. It's highly unlikely that I'm going to have a transformative experience that reveals god and purpose that solves it all in the next few hours a la Cat Stevens or something. I feel that perhaps this is the kind of situation where one should check themselves into the hospital, but the thought of being isolated and constantly monitored for several days is straight up terrifying and sickening, on top of the worry of medical costs and not wanting to strain medical services further as they struggle in the current pandemic. I need an answer. I need something, anything that makes it less horrible. What makes life worth living, in spite of all the evil? How? How does anyone face this and manage to live, to find meaning in life, to wake up and feel like it's worth it? Why shouldn't I try to kill myself again, when evil springs eternal, when I contribute to it myself? Why should I try to go on living in an evil, broken, disappointing world?"

Currently, receiving  any mental health is near impossible because my health insurance doesn't cover any resources in (or remotely close) to my area, (and I can't afford the funds to travel out if I had to).


  Out of despiration,
I turned to God in my darkest times, who continued to promptly ignore me **and actively made things worse immediately afterward.**    Felt like I prayed to demon or something. So turning to God/faith is absolutely out of the question. I'm done tearfully pleading my case to the ceiling.
 

Living each day is like a chore. It's not living. It's nothing but soul-crushing days followed by sleepless nights. Self confidence? Never heard of her. If I had a clear path out, I'd do anything I could not to be me.

266,I find it kinda funny that “normal” people see suicide as unimaginable or something that you’d “never do”.,pekr41,JarJarJacobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pekr41/i_find_it_kinda_funny_that_normal_people_see/,875,SuicideWatch,False,"It hits me every once in a while that normal people don’t think about suicide as often as I do. I’m not even actively suicidal right now, but I consider it often enough for me to realize that I’m one of the outliers in society. So, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.

What gets me though is how that’s *totally* not the case for everyone else. If you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of “suicide” only exists in movies and books. And while it is sad, I actually find that kind of funny.

For example, I hate working. I fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit I don’t want to do for 8 hours straight. But if I tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?

Me: man, I really don’t want a job. I wish I could just sit around doing nothing all day.

Them: well you need money, don’t you?

Me: yeah but I don’t want to get a job.

Them: tough, that’s the way the world works, you lazy fuck. You’ve gotta work if you wanna live.

Me: well technically I don’t *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.

Them: seriously? You’d rather commit suicide than get a job? That’s pathetic.

Me: yep, I’m pathetic. Thanks for reminding me, that’s another reason why I should just kill myself.

Them: wait, you’re serious? Nooooo don’t kill yourself you’re loved and you have so much to live for!!!!

I just find it funny that people don’t consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately If I put a gun in my mouth. They’re like “if you don’t want to live by the world’s rules, you don’t get to live at all >:(“

But when I decide “yeah that sounds fair enough, guess I’ll just off myself then :)” their tune changes and they can’t fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.

Of course I can’t say any of this shit in real life, because I don’t think this attitude helps in the slightest. It’s nice to think and rant about online, but if I started telling people how I really feel I’d get thrown back into the psych ward. Or worse, people I care about would get tired of my moping around and they’d cut me off, and then I’d *have* to go through with it.

Everything’s fucked, and the only *”real”* solution I can come up with is just opting out of life. And if I bring it up before actually going through with it, I can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at “helping”.

Isn’t life fantastic? :D"

Nevertheless, if someone threatened to shoot me with a gun or I was caught up in a situation that endangered my life, I probably wouldn't mind too much. It would be even better if I could sacrifice my life for someone else—maybe then my life wouldn't have been in vain. I recognize the hypocrisy in that statement; after all, if I were willing to sacrifice my life for someone else, then why not sacrifice myself and live for the sake of my family member's life?

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more.

We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm.

2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

2018
I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

In 2020, I got blessed with so many beautiful blessings every moment I wanted to just blow my brains out or jump off the bridge downtown. 
I was introduced to a new friend group just before the pandemic.  We hit it off to the point where I’m now a permanent member. Im still lonely, but i have a way to fight it now.
I’ve always felt like an aggressive asshole who never deserved love, but I rekindled a friendship with someone I’m was once deeply in love with, and although I know  it won’t be mutual, they’ve made it clear how wonderful I am to them. 
Recently, when I was debating dropping out of school and attempting suicide, a close person in my family took their life and seeing how it broke my mom, I decided to keep fighting.
And now, as I sit, depressed and tired in my room, I stumbled upon a letter from my younger sister on how much of a wonderful brother I was and how I need to let go of my demons, and it’s pushing me to go further.
Im not telling anyone that it gets better, or going against the rules on here, I just know that some divine being is telling me to hold on, to grab tight and never let go, never let my light burn out."

305,"Just graduated from college today, planning on taking my life tonight.",bjzs6w,DaBMz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bjzs6w/just_graduated_from_college_today_planning_on/,835,SuicideWatch,False,"Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. I'm going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best I can."

I woke up this morning to my dog barking so I looked outside. I didn’t see anything . It was like 8 am and I was still tired so I just went back to bed. Fast forward to about an hour later, my dog hasn’t stopped barking so I’m a bit nervous. It’s about time for his walk so I put him on a leash and head to the back door. Low and behold, THERE IS A FUCKING DOG IN THE CHICKEN COOP. 

If you look at my post history, you know that I fucking loved these chickens, I raised them with the help of my sister and they were our babies. We originally said we were gonna eat them when we got them but the more we hung out with them, the more we realized how smart and kind chickens are. As stupid as it was, they were part of the family. We named them, celebrated their first eggs. Cuddled them, spoiled them. Like I said, they were family. 

Now imagine the absolute horror I felt when I saw some big ass dog eating my babies while they bleed out screaming, knowing I could’ve saved them if I wasn’t a lazy piece of shit. I ran out there as fast as I could screaming in terror. At first I thought it was just a case of a stray dog because there was a hole in the side of the cage but then I started investigating. 

The dog had a knot around his leash connected to one of the perches that were stapled to the ground. 

The lock on the bottom of the door was open but the top was closed. My sister and I always close the top and the bottom. 

After we got the dog out, we found five alive chickens and put them in a dog cage but he had no interest in them.

The hole in the side of the coop was jetting outward, meaning something tried to escape

I think that what happened was that someone waited for my mom to leave to go to the park 7:40 am, grabbed the dog, put it inside the cage, unhooked it to tie the leash to the perch, the dog tried to get out which in turn led to him biting the hole in the chicken wire, and halfway through the dog’s escape the intruder pulled it back in, causing the bloody pieces of dog fur on the rim of the hole, the the intruder made his escape through the door but since the door was jammed he only locked the top lock.
[My poor babies](https://imgur.com/gallery/sWMUy0l)

It’s probably the same person who broke into our cars about two days ago. I don’t understand why I’m being targeted. I called the police but they of course didn’t listen and just took the dog to paws. Someone needs to be in jail for this. I know that if this happened any other year the police would’ve put more effort but they’re probably just trying to make a statement that blue lives matter just cause I’m black. 

Also my parents and I have been arguing like crazy. I came out as trans (ftm) to them maybe like 2 months ago and it’s been downhill from there. My mom was supportive at first and then I told my dad and she suddenly switched to his side?? Now she keeps being passive aggressive about it by constantly saying stuff like “Some girls have guy features but you don’t. You need to embrace how PRETTY you are. YOURE such a PRETTY GIRL.” My dad finally let me cut my hair but he constantly bashes on trans people saying stuff like “Trans people don’t deserve rights because they’re mentally ill” despite me being not only trans but also schizophrenic. And he also threatens to take away my internet every time I respect anyone’s pronouns. They’ve also been arguing between each other a lot more. Nothing physical but they get really loud and it freaks me out because I have really bad noise sensitivity.

I want to get out of here so bad. Not like my home but this entire existence. I could rant on and on about how much I would enjoy an eternal slumber but I’ve already been typing for like 2.5 hours so I should stop here

TL;DR Someone killed my pet chickens, broke into my car and my parents hate trans people despite me being openly out to them"

313,I just joined reddit. I'm 40 years old and suicidal. I have problems with porn. I've never had sex with a woman.,h887xb,Christian240,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h887xb/i_just_joined_reddit_im_40_years_old_and_suicidal/,829,SuicideWatch,False,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me & called me a mistake. Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery & broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares.

322,My despicable legacy,gq7agw,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gq7agw/my_despicable_legacy/,820,SuicideWatch,True,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine"

Thank you for your support.

He is not the problem. 

I am taking this opportunity away from him while I will feel zero guilt and getting it “done” to stop this neverending hell of isolation, loneliness, severe depression, and zero social support likely to go on for another YEAR due to Covid. I had pretty severe issues pre-pandemic also.

I appreciate ever one of your comments, *all of you* who took time to say anything at all... I know many of you are in the same boat. I hooe you can all join together during this time to help each other. You are all the best.

Wish I could get a gun, so that it'll all go away in a bang.
I have no one. I'm afraid of the future. Only way I could escape this miserable life is death. Never realized how hard it is once I put the rope around my neck.i fucked my career. I fucked up life. At this point everything seems pointless."

Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening."

I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice. 


EDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. "

I'm not working hard, I'm not working at all, I'm just disappointing everyone that has any expectations from me. I'm not reliable, I'm not mature enough, I'm not responsible enough, not emotionally available, I don't have enough energy or even any motivation. I'm just a disaster waiting to happen.

 I'll never be good enough. I used to be, I was a brilliant kid, everyone loved me because I could achieve what they wanted from me, now I can't even dream of achieving what I want from myself.

Constantly being disappointed and frustrated about taking care of everyone around me while my feelings mean nothing to anyone makes me feel kind of empowered about the only thing I have control over. I understand it's not the right way to think and I always fended off these feelings saying it would pass. It hasn't for 27 years. I realized that I've thought about dying and wished for it since my first memory. I've been on medicine. I wasn't happy even when it worked. I just felt trapped. I don't want to keep waking up anymore. I don't want to feel like a disappointment to myself or anyone else anymore. Quarantine probably isn't tremendously helping things but I can't say I felt better before now either.

Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live. They beg people with depression and who are suicidal to ""talk"" well who do we fucking talk to? I don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, I honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. I feel sorry for mankind.

They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did"

Got a nice scar on my right thigh. My mental health has been suffering bad this year dealing with an injury for 6 months from broken bones in ankle and a completely shredded ligament.

Edited again to add this = I shot my thigh because I had to feel something but something made me not shoot my temple so the thigh made sense to me at the time.

My aunt (my mom's sister) is visiting the week or so, and she rarely visits because of how far away she lives. She's super rich and difficult to please, and my family isn't terribly poor but we're low income and a wreck. 

I recently went to the doctor for my mental health issues, I never tell them I'm suicidal because I know what'll happen if I even mention suicidal thoughts. I've been on two different medications for the past few months and neither of them seem to produce any affect. 

My sister who used to abuse me severely as a kid came over the other day, we're both adults now and I think we get along okay, I never really talk to her. Shes kind of psychotic and paranoid beyond fuck, I think she may have schizophrenia or something fucked. But she came in and she said to me, ""OK OP WE ALL KNOW I DID TERRIBLE STUFF TO YOU AS A KID BUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STOP TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE COOL. STOP MAKING ME FEEL LIKE SHIT."" And she went on and on about how I was telling everyone just to turn on her and what not. When I do open up about what she did to me as a kid, in the rare times that I do, I only mention things really briefly and I never say things like, ""she did this horrible thing now go attack her about it."" I just say what happened and that's it. My dad was sitting in the room, and my dad has older siblings and she was like, ""DAD YOU HAVE OLDER SIBLINGS, IM SURE THEY DID SHITTY THINGS TO YOU AS A KID, BUT YOU NEVER WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT IT."" 

Now to top it all off, its my mom's birthday today. And the house is a wreck as usual because she refuses to ever clean. I stay in my room 24/7 and never really clean down there because none of it is my mess, its 90% my mom's own messes, mixed with kids. And my dad came in this morning and woke me up and said, ""do you think you could help mom clean today? It's her birthday."" And I said yeah, and went back to sleep cause it's still morning and we have all day. I was awoken by my mom downstairs at 8 am screeching demonically and throwing stuff and screaming about how much she hates her life, she hates the kids, she hates that I'm a loser who stays in her room all day, she wished I was never born, and a lot of other hurtful and hateful things.

If I didnt have more of a reason to end my life then idk what would be. 

I'm scared to go down there, I was gonna help her clean today but I really dont want to now, birthday or not. 

I'm not sure what I'm gonna do. I havent cut myself in a long time and it is really tempting right now to brutally injure myself and or kill myself. I wish we had a gun."

417,My gf made an attempt,l3xiex,hopefulwaiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l3xiex/my_gf_made_an_attempt/,724,SuicideWatch,False,"She has had the toughest life of anyone I've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person I've ever known. We fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. We make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.

Recently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). I asked again Wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. She said she would ""get there,"" she would be ready soon.

Her anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. It threw me at first, but I realized it was her anxiety talking and did what I could to help her calm down. The anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.

We snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. I woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. She didn't move much when I got up, just kinda rolled over. Same thing when I came back to bed.

I got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. I apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. Nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.

She sent the usual sweet message while I was on my way in. Then right after my work day started (and she knew I couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. When I got the message, I asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. She had reached out to them already, and they were there.

They took her to the ER, she went from there to inpatient.

She took 2500 mg of benadryl. I'm not sure how she woke up. She didn't mean to wake up.

The misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.

Anyway. She has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. She just got cleared to receive the clothes I dropped off her first night in there. She got a fork at dinner tonight.

We've been able to talk a handful of times. She sounds better and more hopeful each time. I'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and I cannot fathom how hard this is for her.

Due to COVID restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books I dropped off. And she has time. She is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). She is feeling hopeful. She said she was really happy about today.

I'm so glad she's getting help. I know she's in good hands. The facility she's at is local, and I have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. I'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.

We have a small but tight support network of friends, and I don't feel like harming myself. I just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and I needed to get this out there.

Update: I just got word that she's been cleared to come home. She has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.

I can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. Each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. I posted here because, although I have good friends whom I can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while I was gone, I felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.

I am so happy she is coming home, and I am so hopeful for the future. I know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but I am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. Together.

Thank you. As silly as it will seem to some people, your comments, messages, and everything have really helped."

It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?"

The first minute was peacefull but then I started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away. If I didn't have my pocket knife to cut the rope I was gone. But I was to much of a coward and cut it. Some people know like my father but they don't care. I really need a hug. I haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. I really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. I am so lonely. I don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday I don't. Am I this bad of a person? U don't think so I'm just mentally unstable. Anyone from Belgium whom wants to be my friend? I don't  want to be pathetic but I'm so lonely I miss love so much.

But do those people know what you struggle with on a daily basis? How hard it is to get out of bed? How hard it is to look into a mirror? How much pain they have been through? It isn’t fair. I give nothing but love and I get shit in return. I feel as if life isn’t right for me. I know I’d hurt people if I were to die. My mother would be destroyed the most but secretly does she know her child is already dying inside? That her child has no reason, none at all to keep trying. I don’t want to be in pain, but the ones I love the most, hurt me the most. So why keep trying? If I love someone so much to the point where they can hurt me 1,000+ times and I still continue going.. why keep going? They obviously don’t care about me, they love the fact that they’ll never lose me. I don’t want to die. I am just tired of feeling trapped in my mind."

Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

Guess what, I said sure, I won't die, I'll go back business as usual. And you know what, it is business as usual. I am never anyone's first choice, I haven't spoken to another human in over a month. Even when I come back from an attempt it's like I died anyway. Really glad I got talked out of it, it would fucking suck if I missed out on being ignored and forgotten again."
434,nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,95icab,pencilwithnoeraser,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/95icab/nobody_cares_if_youre_suicidal_until_you_actually/,725,SuicideWatch,False,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow."

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see."

I wish I had been better to you. I wish I hadn’t hurt us so much.

We were so full of life, of wonder, I long again for that naive awe. When we could stay up till midnight and catch dreams in the palms of our hands. Counting the stars with our fingertips and watching videos waiting for the birds to wake. 

Golden hour and boyhood dreams, waiting for that ‘lucky’ person. I mourn the moments of sibling rivalry and parently hugs, I mourn our happiness. I mourn our innocence.

I’m sorry I never protected you from him. I’m sorry I let it get this far. I’m sorry that you stifle tears when you are touched. 

10 years old. You know you never deserved it, right? You didn't ask for it. You never led him on. 

I’m sorry you want to be abused, I’m sorry that the love you know is saturated in manipulation. He was 18 and you were 13, you knew it was not okay and yet you loved him still. But you were a child, how can anyone ask you to be emotionally mature?

I’m sorry that you are lonely, you’ve pushed them away. You regret it, don't you? You seek love in the bite of a blade, and the kiss of a lit flame.

You want to die and I have caused it. 

I am so sorry."

I was sitting on the pier watching people in the afternoon, taking it all in, mentally saying goodbye essentially. There was a man playing with his daughter nearby, and I remembered the times my dad would play with me in the snow, at the park, and when he explained why the sky was blue and sunsets red, and how his voice trembles when he talks to me now because they're so worried, and how I haven't called him in days because I'm so ashamed of where I am.

I've felt half dead for 15 years and for 15 years my parents guided me to the surface at every step. How can I do that to them and take their only daughter away? There is no way. No fucking way I'll allow those two people suffer like that. 

I called my parents today, picked up my antidepressants from the pharmacy and made conversation with a lovely stranger over ice cream. I'm here, if anyone was wondering. I'm not going anywhere.

It’s completely messed up and I can’t pay my deductible ($250) or the damages ($5,000). I don’t know what else to do. Tried to work everywhere near me, I’ve applied at Johnnys Pizza House, Popeyes, FedEx, UPS, etc. Trying to find work in a desperate time so I can fix my car but nobody is giving me a chance. 

Honestly, days like today really bother me, I never had a dad and my mom raised me by herself the best she could and I’ll always respect her for that. Unfortunately she isn’t around to call on anymore and I think today is the day that we will rejoice. I miss you momma. I miss enjoying life like I did when I was a kid, I miss it so much. I wish I could find something that brings me joy. 

The method I chose to go is by drowning. Something about the water. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and cold. I’ve lived in a very cold world lately and feel like it suits me. I don’t blame anyone for this besides myself. I was trying to decline a DoorDash order and next thing I know I wrecked the only thing that matters to me.

I have nothing now. I don’t have income, I don’t have any food or money, I don’t have family, I don’t have friends, I’m just a lonely 23 year old who wants to escape a life that is beating my ass. Thank you for allowing me to vent Reddit."

""But what if we just stopped existing?"" 
""Is my existence *really* worthwhile?""
""Does your life have any real meaning?""
""Why are you still alive?""

Healthy brains just don't fucking ask those questions incessantly. They don't have existential crises in response to every little task.

There is something so fundamentally wrong with the building blocks of my psyche that makes me hate myself and have no will to exist, and very little seems to touch that basic flaw in my code.

EVERYTHING ELSE IS ACCURATE IN MU POST. ******They have been talking about it last week but let me know they sought out crisis help and for a therapist. Today we were supposed to virtually meet up and they did not show up. Not answering texts either. I’m praying to God that this did not happen. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any other way to contact them or their family. I feel like a piece of shit for not checking up on them or doing anything. I’m praying that this didn’t happen. Oh God

Edit 1: still no reply from them. It’s been ~10 hours since I’ve first reached out to them. I was able to find what I assume their address. Attempted to call their local PD for a welfare check but they are closed on the weekends. No social media of theirs was found. I found their old cell phone number which is either off or disconnected (most likely). I found what I assume their wife’s or daughter’s cell phone which goes directly to voicemail as well.

Please don’t spend your money to give me awards.

Edit 2: Wanted to give you guys a quick update and thank all of you for the well wishes, advice, and just plain support you have provided me in these times. 

This morning I got an email from the company he works for. They told me that he is away due to a medical emergency. This means he is ALIVE. I am so happy all of my and your prayers have been answered. I do not know more details except those from the email but I will try to update you guys with the whole story when I can. I am also not aware if the medical emergency is due to a suicide attempt."

Work in a hospital, diagnosing and treating corona patients. I wish I could sleep, I could really use some rest before the shift.

But I am writing my suicide note and it is getting so long. I am writing about how I have been harassed and bullied by people I don't know. Who attacked me and yelled at me on the street when I was only trying to go home. I want someone to know, and sympathize with me, but I have never told anyone except reddit. I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

Edit: I am a transgender person, that's why people harass me. I suppose they think I am ugly and repulsive. I dont mind if you call me guy, they call me worse things but I wish I wasn't one. Anyway thank you for the sympathetic replies. Sorry, I don't know how to respond because it feels like noone can understand what it is like to feel like everyone hates you. I wish there were more of you out there instead of all these people who will hate you even though you're not hurting anyone. Thank you for saying something nice to a stranger."

Half of the day I feel like screaming out that I want to kill myself so someone will make me feel better and make me not want to kill myself. I know the reaction I’ll get though.

The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed."

Maybe some of you can find yourselves in this update. This is for you.

&#x200B;

I think it was around 3PM yesterday that I decided to end my life. I'd had a relatively uneventful morning. I'd already been on a walk with my mother down to the lake mentioned in my previous post, in efforts to ease some of the emotional tension that had been building for a couple of days. It didn't help. Cutting myself didn't help. I told her I felt trapped.

It was only after the words passed my lips, in the silence of the woods down by the lake, that I realised such language was a hallmark of the suicidal. Trapped. It almost evoked a grin. I hadn't even figured that suicide was already so deeply entrenched in my brain that it was spilling out into my words. I read an excellent book a few years ago where grief was literally a big black bird. It was as if said bird had landed on my scalp and I'd only just realised that its claws were prodding into my brain. What an image.

Afterwards, I got home. Something had finally cracked. I'm not sure what got pills into my brain, but once I'd locked onto the idea, it seemed an obvious choice. I felt a strange sense of clarity and resolution. I knew that it was dangerous to feel that way, but I enjoyed it. I went out into the garden - it was sunny - put my headphones on and listened to the Smiths. I lay down on the grass and crossed my arms over my eyes. I couldn't see, or hear anything (apart from Morrissey). I wondered if this was what it was like to be dead, to have this feeling of being alive but to lack all senses.

The song finished, and I sat up and opened my eyes. Everything was hazy and blue, in that strange way when you've shut your eyes against the sun for too long. It did feel almost heavenly, sat there in the grass. I felt lighter and cleaner than I had in a long time. As stated previously, I'm not a Christian, or any religion for that matter, but it was there in my garden that I first had this sense of God being with me. Everything was beautiful in a way I had never experienced before. It was as if everything had been prepared for me once last time. I felt at peace.

I sat there in the grass until I was called in for dinner. I ate with my family. I couldn't look them in the eyes once. Sticking with the religious theme, it had the same sense of doom as the Last Supper. I almost laughed. I don't know why.

I went out for another walk after dinner, back to the same lake as earlier. I think it had just gone 8PM, so the road through the woods was very empty, and the sun was just low enough in the sky to give that gorgeous golden tint to everything. I have lived in the same house all my life, so I must have walked this road at least a thousand times, but it was as if I was seeing it fresh. The leaves hanging above me looked so light. I saw that golden arch of trees that I mentioned in my other post, just at the end of the road where the woods thickened. It was as if I was being welcomed home. I felt a strange sense of euphoria as I passed through them, like I'd won some sort of prize. I walked past a couple with their dogs. I smiled and said hello. I wonder what the expression was on my face. Did it look as though I was breaking, or was it peaceful?

I got to the lake and sat down on the bench in front of it. The golden light was just skimming the trees - they're tall. It was entirely quiet. I have never known such quiet. The lake was completely still, except for the little circular ripples from the flies hitting the water. The sky had faded into a quiet greyish blue.  It was about 8:30PM. There was nobody else at the lake.

I knew then, in that stillness, that I wanted to go. In that stillness, I felt that every leaf, every pebble, even the rocks at the bottom of the lake had been placed there for me. I don't know whether it was a last-ditch attempt by the universe to get me to stay, or a send off. Like when Simon dies in Lord of the Flies, and all the little silver creatures come to carry his body away on the tide. I think it was a bit of both. It made me feel happy. 

When people freeze to death, they don't feel cold. They feel warm.

I got up, walked back down the road - and the light was fading, but it was still beautiful - and I got home. I messaged a couple of people that I wanted to say goodbye to, just to wish them well. I got changed into my favourite pajamas. I had a cup of tea - how English of me, to have one last cuppa. (I'd never liked this country.) I hugged my mother goodnight and I told her I loved her. I haven't told her I loved her in a decade.

I got into bed - it must have been around 10:30PM by this point - and I wrote my previous post. I'm not sure what I was looking for, by writing it. I didn't expect anyone to respond. I expected it to be the last mark I left on the world. I was okay with that. I hit post. I got a few replies. I responded. It was 11:50PM, I remember it clearly. I turned off my laptop. I went downstairs to get the pills to kill myself.

I barely remember ripping them from the packet. I don't think I felt anything. I was empty as I lined them up. There were only 8, but I'd done my research. One for each year of my life that I'd felt this way. It was enough to die - I don't weigh much - but I realised that it was also enough for me to live. I didn't feel terrible about that. I had responded to one of the comments on my other post about how I was willing to gamble. I had a bottle of water. I was ready.

It was then that I realised my willingness to take a gamble meant that I might want to live. I sat looking at those pills for a long time. I looked at the clock. It was nearly 1AM. I realised I was tired. And the suicide note I'd left was pretty badly written. And there was a party going on, down the street. I figured that even if I took the pills as an act of self harm, not suicide, I'd still have to call an ambulance, and I didn't particularly want that happening in front of a house full of people.

I laughed. It was almost stupid. I wanted to die - I wanted to die so much - but the little things were holding me back. I'd had a perfect send-off from nature. Hell, I'd had a decent last day as a whole. But at the final moment, there were still things that were too amiss for me to go forward. I felt ungrateful. I felt ashamed. I felt empty. But I figured that I could still kill myself another day. It could wait. I went to sleep. I still felt nothing.

&#x200B;

So. I failed, not because I took them, but because I was too afraid to take them. I've been afraid of failure all my life. It's always held me back, but maybe that saved me then.

&#x200B;

I accepted a long time ago that this is just the way it is. Just the way things are. It is the sort of life you might overhear in hushed conversations of the aisles in the supermarket - terribly, terribly sad, and then the conversation is moved on and it is forgotten. Back to the bottles of wine and the crisps.

&#x200B;

But I think there is still a part of me that desperately wants to live. I have so much I want to offer. I write poetry. I want someone to read it sometime. I applied to a summer school. If I killed myself last night, I wouldn't know if I got in. I'm going to refresh my email in a minute, to check.

&#x200B;

I'm here writing this - 11:11AM - and I can still feel that big black bird, sitting on top of my skull. I still want to die. I saved the pills. I put them in a little bag. I understand I might've lost any credibility from my last post - after all, I said I wanted to die and then didn't - but I hope someone is still hearing me. I think I'll take another look at the pills tonight. I hope someone is maybe still holding my hand. I need it so badly.

&#x200B;

But I'm still here, at least for a little while. Maybe a few hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. Maybe just until my 17th birthday. I don't know how long I'll have the courage to hold on for. But I'm still holding on.

I didn't think anyone would listen. This is a really long post - hell, I doubt anyone's reading at this point. But I know I was heard. I woke up to so much love this morning. All I can say is thank you."

But I resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

And while as the pathetic worthless low value man I am, I can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. To blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, I could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200B;

But here I am now hoping to perish. Eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. I don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact I feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

I can still think clearly, in fact that is what I wish I couldn't. I can think so clearly that I'm hoping to die even more.

While I write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that I've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200B;

Not eating have saved a great deal of money, I used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. Though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. My passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200B;

Leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. It has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

But that is not to be, I've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. And as I view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses I realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. I don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200B;

And meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that I might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200B;

Hopefully to never wake up ever again.

To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

There were more than four bottles. It was just whatever I could find. I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die. Waking up, realizing I was still alive, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. It put me in a daze. I’ve felt on pause ever since. I often regret not dying. I feel like I should be dead. I feel like a large part of me did die that day. The only reason I didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. I knew I couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources I felt were adequate. I dropped out of school shortly after. I stopped leaving my house. I see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. I don’t have that. Life hasn’t gotten better.

For all these years, I acted like I don’t give a shit about everything, my parents are extremely carefree, living almost like teenagers the day they got an annulment when I was 4. I didn’t grew up with any of them for my whole grade school and they’ve staggered back into my life when I reach mid-high school, I hate them. They made me feel like a burden, like an excess baggage, like I was holding them back to go on with whatever the fuck they wanted to do. I’m sorry if you made a souvenir from you fucked up marriage, trust me I didn’t want to be born either. I’m sorry if you always see your ex-spouse in my face and all of my mistakes, I’m sorry that I looked like a splitting image between the two of you. I’m sorry if I’m not the daughter you hoped for, I’m not academically smart, I failed my year, I couldn’t tell you. I don’t want to hear your judgement anymore, I already know how much of a waste I am. 

I’ve made my decision since April, I gave myself a small deadline but it kept on extending because luckily schools still have a hard time reopening and I feel pretty shitty leaving the two most important people in my life, my best friends.I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist anymore, so they don’t have to grieve and feel like they could’ve done something to save me but I really am just so tired. I can’t tell anyone how I’m feeling, whenever I opened up I’ll get set aside, told to be strong or they say that they’re for me when they’re really not. I dunno why I decided to spill my emotional baggage to a bunch of strangers in the internet but it sucks when I’m more comfortable opening up here than with my friends. 

It didn’t help either that I’m stuck 24/7 inside the house like most people are during quarantine but there had been riots outside and the government being a huge douchebag to it’s citizens. I know I’m being selfish when there are more important matters in the world right now; racism and discrimination, world hunger, poverty, abuse, people who have incurable diseases. I wonder why the world is such a harsh place, I know that life isn’t fair but what the hell?  If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would. 

I want people to know that I tried. I tried to ask for help, with my family, friends and even try seeking a counselor secretly because apparently, having a mental health problem is considered crazy, an attention seeker or being overly dramatic. My family told me to suck it up, I’ll survive, life isn’t fair. My friends told me they’re there for me but my trust issues says no, suffer on your own, you don’t want to burden them or overshare your sob story, my pride tells me to keep them in the dark with my troubles too because I’ve been perceived as a fighter in our group, I’m always the one who’d they run to when they have a problem, in need of an advice or if there’s a fight amongst us I’m always in the neutral. I don’t want them to see me so vulnerable like this. I reached out to my adviser and then a guidance counselor, I’ve immediately been told that everything between us with be kept confidential UNLESS they see certain signs and they’d immediately tell it to the proper authorities. Yeah, I ghosted him after that message. 

I wonder if those painkillers would really take effect if I swallowed it all. Would it really kill my pain?  

June 25th is my deadline, it sucks coz I’m actually looking a bit forward to my 18th birthday in July 5th but I have to do it. I can’t take anymore humiliation, suffering and disappointment. I’m still a failure.

It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I didn't have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this won't last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive.

And growing up I naïvely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult didn't even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I didn't expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed.

Now I'm at a stage in life where I'm still young, but I've managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I've gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I'm scarred and damaged inside and out. I'm a shell. I've gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I've destroyed so much I don't even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I can't feel happiness, I can't love. I can't feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I'm not considering suicide now, but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began, so I wouldn't have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends.

I was born in a shit city and grew up in shit neighborhoods. Still here, still causing mental issues.

I was born with serious mental issues that caused me to harm people when I was younger.  

Never felt human at all or at least not for too long. Could never ground myself and always fantasized about leaving for another world. 

Ah, also unintelligent, going through school with poor grades, school fucked me up and causes my dreams to be themed around it nearly *every night.* Yet, people think I can make it through college. 

For some reason almost always irritable around family and tired of being constantly asked to do things, just want to be left alone. 

People have this romanticized view of me and contradict the truth that I'm evil and mean-hearted and deserve death. No matter how determined I am and how much I build myself up, I can't escape it. 

Pathetic, unless, unreliable, and a child in their mid-twenties. 

Pandemic has taught me how crazy it can drive you to be the house with people all the time. But I realize this just proves even more how mean I am. 

Considering who and what I am, my family would be lying if they say they wouldn't be better off. Who wouldn't reasonably trade not having to deal with that anymore? Or even for something better. 

Humanity can't seem to accept that some people really are not meant for this and a self-inflicted death would be a positive. But they'd rather shame, guilt, belittle, patronize, and spite you into living...because that is the reasonable way to do it..."

so yeah. i was out in the woods, everything prepared, suicide notes and everything. i decided to try out the noose before putting my head in it, so i put my arm through the hole and jumped off the platform. the knot came undone and everything fell apart.

i had this moment of ”fuck this, i want to live”, so i got out of there and started heading home. suddenly, i felt like trying again, so i went back. i tied a much more secure knot and went in with my head. it hurt like hell. i was wheezing and gurgling and shit, and i guess survival instinct kicked in and i managed to free myself. 

now i’m sitting at this bus stop. my whole body hurts, i’m thirsty, and for some reason, i don’t feel relieved that i lived or anything like that. i actually wish i’d gone through with it fully, but i’m way too tired to go back a third time. i’m gonna go home and take a long nap.

in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please."

Waking up and realizing just what your life has become. Opening your eyes and looking around a room full of the stuff that used to excite you. After years and years of being just barely aware of the passage of time, coming to the stark realization that you have nothing left.

I suppose I should be thankful. I have lived a life overflowing with privilege, and have been just handed over opportunities that most people would have to fight for, and that many never get to have anyway. My parents love me deeply, that I know for a fact. Never in my life have I ever had to wonder where my next meal was gonna come from, or whether I would still have a home when the bills came. I've always had it all, and from this treasured oasis of opportunity I have built nothing but this small room filled with broken toys and half forgotten dreams.

I used to feel angry about the life I've wasted. When the anger ran out and I realized there was no one to blame but myself, I felt sad. Now the decades have slipped by without ever realizing it, what was supposed to be the best time of my life is now behind me, And now I feel nothing. Nothing but a hollow certainty that, just as I longed in my childhood to reach for the stars, now I just long for a quiet funeral, where the very few that cared will mourn and the many that knew my name will soon forget.

After all, time will erase everyone's legacy, eventually. Mine just happens to be close to spent."

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts."

3. My identity as a teacher. There are no jobs in what I teach that can sustain me financially. And I *love* to teach.
4. My apartment. I can barely afford rent as it is, and since I have no savings, I can't renew my lease, which is up on July 31.

So, don't worry, I know. I just want to make it clear that I am diagnosed with Severe Anxiety and I cannot handle embarrassment at all. I normally wouldn't go as far as to say I want to kill myself, but this is a different occasion. 

\[Little NSFW Warning\]

&#x200B;

Last night, I had decided to try masturbation for the first time, normally, I am absolutely revolted by even the thought of it, I am convinced I am Asexual, but I don't want to be. I want to be a normal teenage girl. So, I desperately tried it in hopes it would unlock my ability to feel sexual desire and attraction. I didn't get too far in, being very, VERY hesitant, when my Mom barged in my room to check if I was asleep. I hear her yell ""WHAT WERE \*YOU\* DOING?"", her loud reaction caused my little sister to rush in and also see me, and I'll save the other details.

&#x200B;

We talked after that, and I told her my story of how I was only trying it because I was scared I couldn't feel any sexual feelings, I wish I had've come out as Ace to her right there and then, but I was worried she'd think it was fake. She was so very kind about it, telling me what I tried was normal and that I shouldn't be ashamed that I don't want to do anything like that, and that it was okay. 

&#x200B;

But ever since then, I've been so depressed. It embarrassed me so much, my little sister won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I've felt like utter shit around my mother. I feel so sick that that's forever going to be in her memories, and that she will probably never see me as the innocent girl I expressed I was. The embarrassment and knowing that I cannot change the past weighs me down so much that I just want to fucking kill myself so I don't have to deal with it anymore. I can't sit on my bed without remembering it. This has genuinely made me want to kill myself, and again, I know I'm overreacting. I've tried telling myself that in a few months, maybe even just ***a*** month that this won't matter, but it doesn't work. I feel sick. I don't want to leave my room anymore, I don't want to eat, I don't want to take showers anymore, I don't want to care for myself anymore, because I'm afraid she'll think I'm doing it again (even though I expressed to her that the thought of it was repulsing.)

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, I know no one cares about my weird story, I just wanted to get it off my chest and also ask if anyone knows any tactics to forget memories quicker. Could I just pretend it was a dream? I don't want to feel like this anymore."

please DONT comment something along the lines of ""i care about you"" or ""i love you"". we are strangers on the internet. you dont know me, i dont know you, we dont know them. that means nothing to the receiving end.

please DO share your own experiences and how they may compare or contrast! i and others would much rather like to hear that we are not alone. theres also no harm in wishing others well rather than telling them things WILL get well.


also, please dont be toxic to each other. i can handle toxic comments, but idk other people's headspaces right now and id rather this post be a chill space than a nasty one.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to fall into a coma, but that won't happen anytime soon. Sometimes I just wish my brain wasn't this volatile and would take a chill pill, but a therapist is out of the option since they're very expensive and because of the whole covid situation.

I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  


Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. "

I think I just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(TLDR; Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

I am 35 years old and live and work in Southern California as a Deputy for the last 10 years; I am no spring chicken.  My wife of 7 years and I have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  The stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  We're still very much in love, but its not the same.

In July of 2020 I had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call I had a mental breakdown and I have been out of work since then.

I take 45mg a day of Buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... I am not sure), Xanax as needed as prescribed by my DO (I originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  He has asked that I see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-January. 

I digress...

Because of my line of work, if I talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  So I keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like I am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  My therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

I think about killing myself... hourly? I usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  I cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. I have specific plans on how I would kill myself; the works.  I think about the entire process in detail often.  When I drink I usually come so close to actually doing it that I really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. Which is so ironic to type out.  Clearly I have reservations about killing myself when I am in the right state of mind... but when I am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. I am physically exhausted from all of this I genuinely want the pain to end and I not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

I want to talk to someone about this WITHOUT putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in CA means I cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  I am so heartbroken and frustrated I just don't know what to do anymore.  Every day seems like groundhog day.  I desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  I have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  What a downward spiral the last few months has been.

Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  I really think I will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically I don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. This is so backwards.

I have lost so much sensitivity for no reason. Everywhere on my penis has arounf 10% sensitivity left and my scrotum's sensitivity is almost all gone aswell. Morning wood is super soft, erections are super soft. I'm only 19 and damaged my penis for life. I'm heading to the doctors next friday, but read all on the internet that nerve damage is permanent. In the last 7 months there have been zero improvement in my penis. I can't sleep anymore and can't tell anyone in my life because this is so embarrassing. I've dropped all my college classes except one and failed that class. This has taken a mental toll in my life and I don't think I can continue any longer. The first time I went to the doctors, they just gave me cialis, if they do it again I think I'm done with life. I can't continue life like this, every time I pee, take a shower, wake up with a weak erection, every time I walk I get reminded with the lack of sensations from my groin, I get reminded that I fucked everything up due to my insecurities. I have shut myself off from the world in the last 7 months. I just stay in bed all day or watch this livestreamer xqc which helps me forget until he ends stream.  I went dead silent in my friend's groupchat ever since this happened, I can't just pop in like I have havent been gone for little over half a year.

I know some will say ""you're an idiot for doing this"" and you are correct. I wasn't even small, I'm 6 in long with 4.3 in girth . But how can I feel good about my size when I was hit all my life with that I have a small penis stereotype because I am an asian american. The first time I was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade I remember that girl that said I didn't have a penis because i was asian. That terrified 9 or 10 year old me. Yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like I eat dog and what not. Flash forward to highschool, I'm in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says I have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. Now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. Asians getting blamed and shit, I was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me ""these small dicked asians ruin everything"". I can't say shit except ""shut the fuck up bitch"". Later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. Your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. You shouldn't be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. I've dated 3 girls and none of them complained. I should have felt satisfied from that. If a girl denies you for your size, you dodged a massive bullet, a missile maybe.

I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.


Edit/Update: 

Hello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when I was so low and lost. 

I am alive and yesterday morning I woke up, quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself, I did something that I didn’t actually ever consider I would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic... I wrote a short story. 

Now it’s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but I was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life I believed in me. I finished something, I saw fit to try for once. 

My partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat. I believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic, incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness “melodram-pathetism” and not ever changing. 

For the moment I’m still with her. She’s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware. I will see where this goes but I don’t have a huge amount of hope for her. I have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her, even as a temporary measure. I am acutely aware of how little time I have really had all to myself and how little control I have in my life and it has become very clear, almost painfully so, that if she doesn’t care for me then I think she shall not fight for me. 

Until that point. I want to write. I feel like I need to live for something and that my writing can help. If anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how I can share my work I would be eternally grateful. 

Thank you all for helping me, and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled, gnarled words I put up here; I am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way. Which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really, that so many more like me feel that way. I’m sorry you have also felt like this. I wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love. 

Take care."

Today I saw my grandmother and haven’t hugged her for a while because of COVID but I did today because I thought “well, soon I’ll be gone so I should hug her one last time”

I was sitting talking to some friends and felt really sad suddenly today because I “realised” that I’ll “probably never see them again” 
Holding my friend’s baby ... “he’ll never know me” 

And I’ve been having intrusive thoughts whenever I’m near anything that could be a suicide strategy - steep cliff, long rope, medications, sharp objects, train, fast traffic. “You should ...”, “you could...”, “why don’t you...”.

I know that I don’t want to die. But I’m scared of the thoughts I’m having and I’m scared I’ll lose control and do something.

I also don’t want to hurt myself, but I do anyway because I can’t control myself. Cutting - (recently started again after not doing it for 10+ years)

last fall, one sunday I woke up, maybe ate something(I can't remember very well anymore) and watched Naruto. I really liked the series and still do but after some episodes I just, put my tablet I was watching it on down and laid in my bed, feeling numb.

then I took a shit ton of painkillers. I had tried killing myself maybe even hundreds of times before so I didn't care if it failed but I wished I could finally die.
As my legs started going numb and shaking a bit, I wanted to say goodbye to my friends im our discord group and they got tired of my shit and called me an ambulance, which arrived soon and took me to the nearest hospital which was about 1,5hours away.

in there, some doctor came to ask me about my suicidal intentions and after that my parents came crying to the room and I couldn't even look at them knowing they were so dissapointed in me. my dad was home and mom was at work while the ambulance arrived.

when the ambulance arrived, by the way, they made me drink a huge bottle of carbon mixed with water, apparentaly to stop the painkillers from spreading any further into my body.

after a long evening in the hospital, they just sent me straight to a psych ward. I was in there for a month (while in suicide watch, I think).

my time in the psych ward was okay, I got friends and I met my current girlfriend in there, but my family never acts the same around me anymore. My parents still keep checking my room every 30 minutes to see if I'm okay and always ask questions like ""are you upset?"" or ""you aren't gonna do anything stupid again are you?"" and so on. I rarely even get any private space anymore. In school people look at me disgusted, probably because rumours about my suicide accempt have been spreading around. i skip almost all of my classes, sometimes I just sit im the schools restroom floor, staring down or go to the library to read books about suicide and death.

needless to say, my grades are dropping really fast. I always knew I had no future, but now it's certain. I wish my accept last fall would've worked and I would be dead now. my family is dissapointed in me and has given up on me. I live on meds and without them I'd probably starve myself to death, but I want more of a painless and quicker way to go.

I should just die, what the hell. but how.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

Sorry, just needed to write about this...and I think this is a safe place.

Edit: I'm glad some people can relate to this, we'll be okay, eventually. One day this will all end and we won't need to use suicide as an exit. Always remember that."

I studied hard and worked hard, competed in inter school competitions and such, only to get a feeling of dread at the new expectations instead of joy at my success. I still hope its a phase, but its been 5 years now, and if the rest of my life is going to be like this, might as well end it early. I never had friends and intentionally distance myself to people.

I have been dealing with so much resurfacing childhood trauma lately and I am dissociating heavily. Last night I went to bed praying for God to kill me in my sleep, and the thought of it actually happening made me feel so calm and content. I woke up multiple times during the night in complete panic and everytime I woke up I just started praying for God to kill me when I fall asleep again. 

I almost did it myself a few months ago, but I was able to resist the urge and stick around a little longer. I planned everything and I still have that exact same plan in my mind. I have the equipment and I can do it whenever, but I seriously am trying to fight the urge. It's tough. 

I felt better in the morning but during the day I have started to dissociate more and more, and right now as I am writing this, I have no clue what the fuck is even going on. I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense, but I am trying my hardest. All I can think of right now is death. The thought of taking my own life gets me full of excitement and makes me feel almost complete euphoria. I held the rope in my hand today and just couldn't stop smiling. I tried tying the rope around my neck and adding a little pressure, and I loved the feeling of not being able to breathe and my ears starting to ring. Not being able to think. I have a red mark around my neck from it. I have been suicidal since I was a kid ( my mom even told me that she once found a suicide note I wrote when I was 7-8 years old ) but I have never been this close to actually doing it. I have swallowed some pills in the past but nobody knows about it and I know that I really wasn't ready to die back then so I wasn't trying seriously. 

The more the years pass, the more suicidal and unstable I become. Taking my own life doesn't feel like a fantasy anymore, it feels like a reality that is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't even scare me in the slightest anymore, I have just come to accept it."

I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

All for what? So we have money to put a roof over our heads, food on the table, and maybe a couple of beers on the weekend.

That's bullshit. How fucking boring is that, that's not the life I want. Yet that's probably the life most of us will have. What a waste of time, money and energy, it's all so pointless. No one's gonna remember us a 100 years from now, it'll be like we never existed.

I carry the suicide note I’ve already written in my wallet. I break down and cry every day. I think about dying almost every minute of the day. I do not sleep well, I won’t eat for days at a time. I’ve lost all motivation and hope for the future. I’m 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date.

I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. It’s hard to fake being okay. I’m only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life.


Edit: First off i’d like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. I did not expect any of that. Also, I’ll share my story for those that have asked. 

When I was a child I was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. Despite the abuse I loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and I was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. The abuse did not stop however until I was in my early teens. In high school I was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. Never any aspirations for the future. When I graduated I went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. He and I do not have a good relationship to this day. In the 7 years since, I have tired but have failed many times to get through college. Ive had many failed relationships that ended because I was always lied to and cheated on. Ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and I feel that my brain has turned to mush. Though now I only smoke weed and drink often. Recently I’ve gone through a break up that I feel has tipped me over the edge. We used to live together and we were happy for a while. For the first time in my life I felt that I had a purpose. I thought I could build a future with her, which is something I was never able to visualize with anyone else. For the first time in my life, I saw a future that wasn’t grim and full of failure. Unfortunately I could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. We’ve been sleeping together almost weekly and each time I feel that there’s a chance i can fix things. But she shoots me down each time. About a week ago she told me she’s taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. She will be leaving in late August. Before I even got this news I was already planning on ending my life. I had my suicide note ready. I’ve been packing things away and trashing other things. So that my loved ones won’t have to. But now I’m afraid that when she leaves I will not have the strength to push through until December."

You make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and I get into my cab. You're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. 

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. 

If i have to be alone tonight, I wish it could be for the last time.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!! 
And thank you everyone for your kind words. I'm glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too."

I think about how, after my mom passes, I’ll die. I think about sending my boyfriend and the dog away to visit his family, and then finding new homes for my cats, and then just ending it. I know there are people other than my mom who love me, who would be sad if I died, but they’d move on eventually. They have other friends and family. They don’t -need- me.

I tried to tell a friend recently how I’ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancé and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesn’t need me.

My boyfriend, he might need me, but I don’t feel like I’m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I can’t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesn’t mean I’m good for him.

I don’t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes. I don’t want to spend another 30+ years struggling on this earth. I never even imagined I’d make it into my 30s. To make into my 60s? Impossible. What’s the point?

Life just feels so meaningless. Even when I try to find meaning, I always hit roadblock after roadblock. Depression and anxiety always hold me back. I’m so tired of trying, of fighting, of being. I feel like I’m just waddling through life, surviving via distraction, waiting for death."

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

Feel free to reply with what you want. I'm alone again on a Saturday night anyway. I've got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do."

I know I needed help. Yet the doctor send me away. In the next hour I was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. Which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. 

The attempt caused me to have surgery. Note, I’m extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. So I tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. After a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. I told them i didn’t want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. This made me have a severe panick attack. I was left alone.

After a while I got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. They wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but I didn’t give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. I got dragged to seclusion because of this. 

This morning I got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. The surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. The doctor came and told me I was free to go. I told him I will try to kill myself again. He said that thats a risk he’s willing to take. 

Right now I’m sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what I should do next.

I don’t want to die or end my life but I feel like I don’t have another option. I constantly think about it. I just want to be free and released. 

I am 30F. My parents are in their mid to late 60s. I lost my job back in March because of corona. My mother had a stroke last year and needs constant help with everything. She’s also always been codependent. My father has Parkinson’s and is getting worse slowly. He has always been and continues to be belligerent, verbally and light physical abuse. I am the oldest of 3. My siblings also live at home but one is physically disabled and one is very mentally ill. 

I barely get 5 hours of sleep everyday. I constantly go back and forth between taking care of my mom and dad and brother (mentally ill disabled). All bills are on me. Our house is at risk for foreclosure. The house is in my fathers name and I can’t do much because of that. I can’t get him to stand long enough to go to the dmv to renew his ID so he can go to a notary. 

I also have an auto immune disease that degenerates your spine slowly but thankfully it’s very slow and I’m still able to do a lot just with chronic pain. I just wish so badly that I can just live for myself. I want to wake up and just solve my own problems. Worry about only myself and feeding myself etc. I’ve never had a chance to live life for myself. I’ve had to help my parents since I was a teenager. 

I can only see things getting better once my parents both die but that’s not happening for at least 15 years. I love my mother and don’t want her to die or feel like a burden. She’s trying to do physical therapy and recover. I get so jealous when I see other people my age just being their age. Living on their own, only having to worry about themselves. Only cooking for themselves. Able to do self care and able to go to work. Even if I got a job I will probably lose it because I would have to call out a lot to take care of my family. 

We cannot afford a home health aid. I’ve tried with the insurance they won’t cover it. I’ve tried to get paid as my mothers home health aid; they won’t cover that. I have constant anxiety. I just want to be able to worry about my own problems and take care of myself. I just want my own life. If I’m lucky maybe I’ll be able to start living when I’m almost 50 years old. 

I don’t want to commit suicide because I know of the beauty in life. I know it’s possible for me to be happy. I just don’t see a way out alive right now. I didn’t know where else to post. Anywhere else I’ve posted I haven’t had any replies. If you’ve read this, thank you. I wish you a good 2021. 

I appreciate any replies.


EDIT: I just wanted to edit this post in case anyone checks back. First off, thank you so much for all of the awards and replies. The response has overwhelmed me and made me feel less alone. I hate that other people are going through what I am but it makes me feel like I am not alone. 

Second, just to answer a few common replies. My family has been through social security and disability. My parents are literally dollars over the line set by the government for SNAP and other assistance. We have been denied many times. My sister receives disability but it took many denials and paying a lawyer in order to get it. It’s also a very small amount. My brother was also denied and a lawyer says mental health disabilities are harder to get approved. If anyone has info or has been through getting disability for mental health reasons (my brother has schizophrenia), please reach out to me.  

Recently we applied for disability for my mother and she was denied because of my father’s pension and not having enough working credits. My mom turns 62 in June so we are looking forward to her early basic social security and maybe being able to get her on Medicare. Her private insurance through my dads old work (he’s retired) doesn’t cover paying me as a home health aid or even hiring a professional home health aid. I am hoping that’s something I can do through Medicare when my mom can get it.


My father recently got Medicare but after doing a screening with a nurse and everything they say he doesn’t qualify to pay for a home health aid. My father has his good days still and loves to hide his abusive and weak side. I tried to get my father into a nursing home but he doesn’t meet the criteria. In may my father stayed at a inpatient rehab after a fall, for about 2 weeks. I told the social worker all the issues going on. I told the doctor who asked why he was on psych meds, that he was abusive and I didn’t want him to come home. That I didn’t want to and couldn’t care for him AND my mother. That his moods were unstable. The doctor offered nothing, wouldn’t even change his meds or offer a plan for discharge. No one flinched at me saying I can’t care for him or that he’s abusive. They simply didn’t see it as their problem to help. Even the social worker. 

I have tried getting snap benefits for myself but because I live with my parents they’re included in the household. I also forgot to mention I live just outside of NYC. So our mortgage is very expensive as you can imagine. 

I am sorry if I rambled. I’m trying to get out and remember all of the details. The most important thing I have to say is THANK YOU. To everyone that awarded, replied, messaged, and even just read my post. I promise you I am NOT going to kill my self. I don’t have plans or ever make or think about plans. I just felt hopeless and felt like no one else was listening. From the bottom of my heart thank you to this subreddit."

Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing."

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

725,I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,8r97s7,whocares4000,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8r97s7/i_was_born_a_hermaphrodite_and_i_want_to_die/,546,SuicideWatch,False,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

I cant go to the mental health hospital because of how traumatizing my 5 day stay was. My wife held me then. She told me everything was going to be okay and I wouldn't have to go back. They need to give me a feeding tube and pain meds and just let me go as fast as possible. Additionally I cant afford to even miss 1 day of work. They keep you there so long.

It's all so overwhelming & no one is listening. I've been practically alone my entire life, I dropped out of school In 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe I just couldn't couldn't go & no one cared enough to make me go. Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I've dreamt of practically all my life & they're so far away. It's becoming unbearable at this point. My mother & I aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me & I called the cops on him. I don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends & I live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. I'm living off my mother & the minute she decides I have to go I'm going to be homeless. Recently I've been begging her to take me to just get an id & help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me & I know this is my problem but i don't have any money & I don't know what or how I'm supposed to do it.

At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. 

It sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal."

754,"Hypogonadism (and the doctors who ""forgot"" to treat me early enough) is the reason I've had such a miserable and humiliating life.",lawwu3,curiousfox25,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lawwu3/hypogonadism_and_the_doctors_who_forgot_to_treat/,527,SuicideWatch,False,"For those who don't know, hypogonadism is when someone's body doesn't make enough (or any at all) testosterone. This has a range of effects on your body and it also affects your body in different ways depending on what age it starts.

As a boy going through puberty, the lack of testosterone caused me to develop breasts (severe gynecomastia) & completely inhibited any growth of my penis. Instead of getting testosterone shots ASAP my doctor decided to wait and see if I was just a late bloomer...

I'm 26 now and only now getting hormone replacement therapy in the form of weekly injections of testosterone & hCG but it's too little to late: my body is permanently child like and there are no medical solutions to reverse the physical affects. (I should probably also include that this stunted muscle, height and body hair growth)

When this first started happening to me the worst part was having to attend school every day as a male with boobs. The humiliation and anxiety I felt every day trapped in classrooms full of people who almost daily tried to rip my shirt off just to laugh at me is painful to think about even right now. I'd have to hide in the gym locker rooms as much as possible, I had to hide from everyone and everybody because even my own brothers would occasionally bring a group of friends just to humiliate me so even my ""escape"" from all this (locked myself in my room and played video games to distract myself as much as possible) I wasn't safe even in my own home. I completely stopped playing basketball even though I was so passionate about it back then. Still to this day I don't feel comfortable going outside to do shit as simple as go to the grocery store.

The worst part is that I still have this on my chest (literally) even at the age of 26. That means I've been living in a legitimate hell locked inside hiding from life its self for 14 years now. There are surgeries to remove the breast tissue and attempt to make my chest look as normal as possible and I actually did get this surgery when I was 13. Problem is my hormonal issue that caused this was never resolved, and my body simply kept making more breast tissue because I was still developing. Obviously considering how much this affects me I abandoned any idea of going to college or starting a career because whether or not it makes me a bitch I cannot handle being trapped like I was when I was younger. So I have absolutely no way to throw down $10k on a surgery that would at least resolve that part of my humiliation.

But even with all that said the thing that makes me want to kill myself the most is having a permanent childs penis and having nothing I can do about it. There are no surgeries like the gynecomastia surgery, there are no pills or methods to legitimately help resolve this problem. I already know what most peoples first reaction to hearing about my penis problem is because I've been told countless times it ""doesn't matter"". To me it does matter. I will never feel comfortable in my own skin, hell I don't even feel comfortable feeling like I'm my own gender.

Most people don't pay attention to this but when you're someone like me it's hard to escape this as it's literally everywhere - small dicks are brutally made fun of even in a society that pushes against body shaming. Frequently attached to the worst people of our society - I've seen people attach the notion that criminals and even mass shooters are the way they are because they have a small dick. Almost daily I come across people making fun of me indirectly in the most random places even on reddit, and even though gaming is my ""escape"" the communities inside them and sometimes the actual games themselves (borderlands 3 for example) don't forget to remind me what a humiliating life I actually have all the time. There were times where my own friends would make a joke about it and I had to sit there laughing with them, at my own self, just to not raise suspicion. Shit's depressing.

Before anyone does give me the cliche responses or offers to tell me it doesn't matter because of x y z, I beg you to think of how insecure & scared men are about their penis sizes even if they are entirely normal. They are SCARED by the idea that they might actually have a small penis, imagine actually living with one. I can't wear even the smallest condoms the FDA approves for sale, they just slip right off, and every partner (3 total) I've ever had we could not get penetrative sex to work at all. So my advise is to start treating my medical issue like a medical issue, instead of trying to be a hero through words when my experiences contradict every fucking thing said to me so far. I'm even infertile because of this disease which is just another thing happily taken away from me to ever experience.

All this being said I'm beyond hopeless. I've been trying to get help through any means possible for years now. 4 ER trips, 1 inpatient hospital visit and a suicide attempt later I am still no where closer to getting help even after seeing therapists, psychiatrists, endocrinoligists, urologists. All of them  are so obviously unprepared to deal with my situation that it's been abundantly clear that there is a massive lack of understanding or knowledge when it comes to treating people like me.

I don't have it in me to keep living like this, the humiliating and anxiety driven experience my life has been so far isn't going to end unless I end it. I tried as much as I could because I love the friends I have and the two girls in my life (gf & mom) love me so much but at some point I think even they will understand because they see what this is doing to me. I just hate the idea that this is going to hurt them so this post is my last effort to get the help I always needed I guess but if I'm being real with myself this is probably my suicide note or a way to get my story out there to people so this never happens to anyone ever again."

I always wear shorts at home and our house is pretty conservative and packed with family members, with a few older men such as my cousins and uncle. I always get anxious so I have this habit of bouncing my leg up and down. My mom scolded me about it multiple times, telling me to not do it because it means “attracting people to have sex with me” ( I am 16 by the way, the youngest in our household with the exception of my nephew). This time she was in a bad mood and unfortunately caught me bouncing my leg while wearing shorts which means my upper thigh is a bit shown. We were upstairs in the bedroom and she was using a small knife to cut off the straw from a box of groceries. The moment she caught me she fucking yelled at me saying that I was being a whore and stuff like that. I tried reasoning with her calmly and told her it was because I’m anxious about my school but she didn’t budge. She kept blabbering about what might happen if one my cousins or uncle saw what I was doing or the way I was dressed, they’d think I’m inviting them to have sex. I told her that just because I’m doing this does not mean I want to have sex because my neither my actions nor my clothing mean consent. She continued arguing about how they may be my relatives but they’re still “men” and added that she hopes I get raped so I’ll learn my lesson. I tried to counter one last time but then she fucking flung the knife right at me. She obviously missed on purpose but at that moment, my whole life fucking froze. She was fuming at me and said that next time I say things about consent and shit like that she won’t miss anymore.

Now, before I had been doing self harm and once even attempted to commit suicide. In those times, my mom was so hurt for me and kept telling me that my life mattered and all that shit. When I realized how much I was hurting her before I stopped no matter how depressive my state was. But now, my own fucking mother wanted me to die and hell, get raped. You know, I’m thinking, maybe I was right before. About just dying. Everyday I think about dying but I try so hard to stop myself from having these thoughts because I love my mama. But just when I’m starting to recover, my own mother wants me dead and literally fucking flung a knife at me. Sure, she missed but what if she didn’t? What if it didn’t kill me but left me fucking incapacitated? What if did really kill me? I was happy that I’m slowly getting better but right now, I might as well be better off gone.


Edit: Hi, so I just want to let you guys know that this was the first time I’ve ever talked about my problems at home. I don’t talk about it to literally anyone, even my friends and I do not have a therapist. I just wanna say thank you for all the support and I promise I’ll try my best to stay here. :D

Edit 2: Just wanna inform you guys that my mom has high blood pressure which might explain her explosive attitude but most certainly won’t excuse them. From now on, I’ll refrain from arguing with her for the sake of both of our health. Also, for everyone telling to hit up CPS, I appreciate your advices but our country’s CPS here is mostly for juveniles (correct me of I’m wrong) and like, rebellious kids I think and kinda treats them badly so I don’t think they’d do my mental health any better. Strange as it may be, my mom is the only parent I have left since my dad’s out the picture (another reason why I stopped trying to kill myself, I didn’t want my mom to be alone). She’s all I have right now and basically, all I can do right now is try to keep things as smooth as possible to avoid any more trouble in the future."

No ability left in my hands to use the gun laying at my feet, I was a plank of wood flat on the ground, that was until the the vomiting on to myself happened. I spent what felt like hours like that, the pain worsening, I felt at peace. It stopped all at once, I woke up to beeping and buzzing, my stomach had been pumped. 
So if you’re wondering if I’m still here yes, yes I am I’m just really fucking bad at killing myself. Next time, when I get out of here I’ll just go straight for the gun. I’ll apologize about the mess on a post-it. I always wasn’t one to make someone clean up for me but if I go out, that’s all I really care about. 
I’ll be in the ICU, until they know all my whatever the fucks are stable, I guess downing a bunch of anti psychotics isn’t safe, at least that’s what they told me. 
The worst part about this, is I just feel everyone on here will be happy to hear I failed, like this isn’t a throw away and these will probably be my only two posts, and that I will succeed one day. Maybe I’ll come back here for that rant, or maybe this was just bad luck.

I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself."

About a month ago my partner of 20 years told me that she thinks she’s gay. We have kids, a life, a hoped-for future. Now she wants to consider an open relationship initially and that long term thinks her future will be with a woman.

Then a week later she quit the professional training she’s been doing. Her whole life she has only managed to get short-term low paid jobs. She was 2 1/2 years into a 3 year process to be qualified in a professional career path. She would have qualified in May and been able to start getting paid work in that specialism. We’re left with the debt of the studies without the financial opportunity of the qualification. 

And then yesterday she tried to kill herself. She researched online how to prepare a noose and bought the kit. She went for a walk to a secluded wooded area near us. She had everything in place but stopped just short of the jump. 

Then she went and stood by a fast moving road planned to step in front of one of the large trucks that thunder along it. But again, couldn’t do it. 

Then she came home, got in the bath and started cutting her wrists. Drew blood but stopped before it was fatal. 

I was unaware of all this until this morning when she showed me her wrist and then told me about the other two attempts. I had to unpack the belt and rope from her bag. Untie the noose and hide it somewhere. 

I’m devastated. Numb. Terrified. I love her deeply. We have teenage children. We have a good life. 

I’m upset and sad for her that she’s so ill. Mental illness has attacked her for years. She’s on meds and has a therapist. 

And I feel guilty for feeling so angry. I know that what she needs right now is kindness, compassion and support. And yet I also feel a boiling rage at the shit that has been dropped on me. I know she needs the opposite of anger right now. 

I don’t know what to do.

His sister said that he was ""too sensitive for this harsh world"" – and you know what, so am I.

Or Jack London.

Osamu Dazai – “I want to die more than ever before. There's no chance now of a recovery. No matter what sort of thing I do, no matter what I do, it's sure to be a failure, just a final coating applied to my shame.”

Ryunosuke Akutagawa – ""I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely, I have no regrets. I just feel sorry for anyone unfortunate enough to have had a bad husband, a bad son, or a bad father like me. So goodbye, then ...""

Luigi Tenco.

Dalida – ""Life is unbearable for me. Forgive me.""

Kurt Cobain.

Anna Kavan – “I haven't felt anything for 20 years.”

Alejandra Pizarnik.

Vsevolod Garshin.

Steve Cash.

Mark Linkous.

George Sanders – “Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.”

And countless more.

All those artists, writers and musicians who brought joy and comfort to my life, they all suffered throughout theirs, and died young due to severe addictions or eventually killed themselves.

For years, I haven’t enjoyed anything. I want nothing from this life – I want out."

772,id kill myself for a hug,mlal20,remremiah,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mlal20/id_kill_myself_for_a_hug/,523,SuicideWatch,False,"im 15 years old, introvert, i have a christian family, and we live in my grandmother's house.

i have an abusive father, who i always feared ever since i was born because of how he reacts on things. it feels like he could kill me at any moment. just hearing him talk gives me goosebumbs. he beats me up for being lazy and stupid at chores while my mother just watch as these things happen.

i don't see him as a father figure to me because of what he is. he is lazier than me, he doesn't have a job and he always ask my mother for money. he wants me to work, he's such an asshole. he isn't alcohic but he is a drug addict. and going to rehab didn't really didn't change that much to him.

i never thought of being depressed, but growing up made me to. i am a lights operator in our church but they don't really care about knowing me. they just want my skills which makes me want to leave. going to church and having fellowship with my fellow teens makes all that sadness go away. but everytime the fellowship stops, being lonely and sad takes over me again. i only have a few friends to talk to in church and i don't think anyone wants to talk to me. not everyone even the pastor talks to me.

i have a few friends at school and a best friend but going to school is so boring.

my cousins in my mother's side, live in a different house and they are just always there for me. we watched tons of movie franchises, introduced me to a lot of games and whenever they come on vacation they want me to come with them. they know how abusive my father is and they want me to leave home and live with them. but the fact that they always yell at each other and they always fight is just so annoying and it drives me insane.

in the looks of it, this year 2020 got me trapped with my family for 1 whole year. i never thought it's going to be fun, there no church service and being trapped with an abusive father drives me insane and it's making my depression so much worse.. my family including my aunts and cousin always fight and they always yell.. i cant sleep very well. and fuck i cant even do my homework. i don't want to talk to my friends about what i feel just because i don't trust them.

there is alot of times in a middle of a lockdown where i was left at home with my father, and he kicks me out of the house for waking up late and being lazy and i dont know where to go in the middle of the pandemic. there was no one there to defend me, my mother was at work and i don't want to go to cousins house because they drive me insane.

well its not his house we why the fuck kick me out.
my mom knows how abusive he is and she also knows about him kicking me out. but she doesn't even bother to do anything. my mother is so kind to this idiot and that's where i thought she'd pick his husband rather than his children, and there is nothing i can do about that.

just how toxic and messed up this life is.

things are so messed up.

i never thought i would ever do this but i just wanna leave, leave my family behind. disappear forever. never comeback. no one knows i felt this way. not literally anyone. not even me. 

i kept asking my self why the fuck is everyone so fucking toxic!!! it just hurts me so much. so much pain id rather kill myself than leave.. because i am nothing without them. they are my family, but they also let me down. but i'll still do it, even if how hard it is. 

i must have a lot of money when that time comes 3 years from now.. i'll pack all of the things that i bought myself. meet with my best friend. maybe kiss her goodbye for a good friendship she gave me. and leave forever and never comeback. maybe find another love. maybe find a job.. maybe fulfill my dreams.. 

or just kill myself.

my thoughts: i hate how people say they want to end their life because of how miserable their life is but read this and think straight if you are going through this much pain as me. no one, not even my best friend and family knows about this. only you, me and the next person reading this. i hope i have someone to talk to about my feelings. i don't know what to do. i feel like i could end me any second now. im not afraid of dying because i'm already living in hell. 

this is very tough for me, the whole world has a problem right now and this is happening to me all at the same time.

it's too much.

no one is serious enough to talk to me and so if you reached this far,

i love you.😢❤️

EDIT: thank you guys for all the hugs, all the advice and all the support. i appreciate it more than enough because it made me feel much better for now.."

I'm thinking of ending it tonight. I went on a walk down to this lake by my house and God, it was beautiful. It was like one final send off from nature - almost as though in that moment, it had been put there for me. The lake was perfectly still, and that golden light was just gracing the tops of the trees. I'm not actually religious, but I think it was the universe's way of telling me to let go, to return to God.

I'm suicidal for a whole range of reasons. Have been for 8 years - half my lifetime. I've never come so close to ending it before. Something suddenly clicked a couple of nights ago and things became too painful to bear. The straw that broke the camel's back. I started cutting again. It didn't help. Nothing makes a dent in this pain and shame.

I can't tell if this handful of pills means I actually want to go, or if it's a cry for help. I know it's pathetic - but I think I'll only take 8, that's in the potential danger zone for people of my weight. It will be in the hands of the universe to decide if it's my time to go.

I just want someone to hear me. There are 690 people online. I hope someone's there to listen. I hope someone will maybe hold my hand over the internet if I go. It's a funny image, those hands reaching through those computer screens, but it makes me tear up.

I hope that if I succeed, someone else fails. Your life is worth something, if you're reading this. Mine isn't.

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"

On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all."

787,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,eax3lg,Caterworm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eax3lg/i_want_to_commit_suicide_on_xmas_eve_just_like_my/,518,SuicideWatch,False,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

Thanks, Reddit."

Don't worry, I'm not looking for any help.  I'm only here to get this off my chest.  

31yr old male here in the U.S.  My fiancé had an affair, and took our 4year son.  I only get to see him on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  I'm a very ""all or nothing"" kind of person. Same as my parents. As shitty as this may seem, I'd rather be gone that deal with the pain. 

I've spent the last 5 months setting this up, and I'm completely come to terms with my decision.  I always plan ahead, and I have set up a trust account for my son, an email address for him, a 529 account for college, etc.  My Will & last testament has been completed, and letters have been written, all photos have been transferred to hard drive and my apartment packed up and cleaned (lease up in 3 months).  I was even able to cross a few things off my bucket list in the last few months which was nice.

I've got a very discrete spot picked out that me and some friends would go camping at in college, and I've gathered all materials. (A ridiculous amount of heavy pain pills, 3 bottles of prescribed codeine/promethazine cough syrup to prevent throwing up, my favorite alcohol, and old car, and a gun just in case.  A little extreme I know, but I'm not afraid of dying....I'm afraid of surviving. 

I just wanted to thank reddit for always being there.  I'll most likely be painlessly surfing reddit and listening to a few of my favorite songs in my last moments in my car waiting for the carbon monoxide to do its job.

Godspeed"

when  life is just one big pain in the ass

to me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time ...this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enough
its so cold and boring and so so tiring
it's really dreadful 


some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can ""heal"" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried EVERTHING to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that Really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die."
833,Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,fsxvr5,KarsonKrusher,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fsxvr5/young_doctor_29yo_with_suicide_thoughts/,489,SuicideWatch,False,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly"

Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered ""Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?"" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked ""What were we talking about""

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does? I'm just a waste anyways."

837,"My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal)",kgaidi,jasmineteeleaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kgaidi/my_bf_thinks_suicidal_people_are_all_weak_cowards/,488,SuicideWatch,False,"This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. 

So quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.

Flash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. 

One of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)

I won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. 

__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.

__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. 

__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. 

__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.

__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?

__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?

__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.

__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.

__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?

__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.

__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??

__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.

__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!

__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”

__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!

__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?

__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!

__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.

__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.

__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?

__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.

__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)

__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.

__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?

__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.

__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.

__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?

__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._

__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!

__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?

__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.

__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???

__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.

__Him:__ ....

__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ ...

__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.

__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.

__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. 

__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?

__Me:__ no.

__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.

__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?

__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.

__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.

__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__

__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?

__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.

__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?

__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.

__Me:__ literally what you said.

__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. 

__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.

__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!

Anyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._

__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?

__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!

__Me:__ lol.

I’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.

Honestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.

I know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. 

For anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. 

Anyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening."

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

My mom walked in when I was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where I'd cut later tonight. She said ""I just wanted to see you."" I had to hide my body under the covers so that I could keep her from seeing what I had done to my arm and my body at that point. She came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""It's comfortable,"" she said. I tried my best to hold back tears. 

She eventually left and now I'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why I'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. All I can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. I can imagine her crying. 

I feel like a waste of money and time. The thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. The time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. The only time I enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. I am less than mediocre at both. 

My whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. I've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. I've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so I can make my other friends jealous. I lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what I want them to do. As for the attention whoring, I've done enough of it in my early teens. At 14, I was telling men online that I was 18. Id send them pictures of myself so that I could get validation. I craved the romantic attention that I never got at that age.

It's now 12am and I'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. I've taken breaks while typing this and I feel like I'm ready. I just need some validation that I'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

So. Speaking of decisions that I made that fucked up my life.
I'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) I have given to myself. I, as the attention whore I was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. I sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. The next scoliosis check that I had, I was told to get checked for scoliosis. Lo and behold, now I'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
I also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that I could get glasses. Now I'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that I'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
I AGAIN fucked up my life when I decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be Christian. Now I've been working at my church for 6 years. I've also been attending and tithing every week. I'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. After 14 years of church, I still don't know what the fuck is going on.

I'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

I'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

I'm tired of lying to people

I'm tired of being a waste of time and money

I'm tired of being completely mediocre

I'm so tired 

It is now 1am and I'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and I've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you I'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time.

I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

I have autism the supposed high functioning kind but that's a load of shit. There is no such thing. There's fucked and slightly less fucked.

The cherry on top? It was preventable. My 'wonderful' mother couldn't stop puffing her cancer sticks for nine months. So I get a lifetime subscription to the shit show that is my brain.

It gets better though. In gradeschool I was abused. My lovely aunt and grandmother buried it because , I don't know. Reasons. This escalated my behavioral issues in school and at home immensely. Rage doesn't even begin to describe it.

.

School was boring as hell. I had autisim I wasn't retarded. But the lovely school system couldn't tell the difference. So I was stuck in Special Ed, not being challenged at all. By all rights I should've been three grades above where I was. Public schools like uniformity. Different is anathema to them.

So my second year of middle school I said fuck it and quit going. I wasn't getting anything out of it anyway. Contrary to what most adults and parents think...you can't make a child do anything they don't want to do. They tried to make me go back. I refused. When my father hit me with the belt I called the police on him.

It was the last time that ever happened.

At fifteen or sixteen I got my highschool deploma from a by mail school. Mostly out of spite. It was a waste of time and money.

My general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job. Well almost.

I worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where I had wrecked my back. 0/10. Would not recommend. Money was great however it destroyed my developing body. I suffer from chromic pain now. Which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back...and on bad sees me unable to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without suffering from muscle spasms.

I digress.

At twenty-five(I think)  I moved across the entire US to get away from them. With my then girlfriend/fiance. In retrospect it was a doomed relationship. While I cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more. I had grown to hate them.

I had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences. I left again a short time later to be with another girl. At age thirty no less. I've been with this one since. If not for the disability laws we'd be married now.

My life had finally come together. We moved back to help tend to my ailing father. Stage four cancer. It was in 'remission'. or supressed. Whatever they do to keep it undercontrol.

I was healthier. Until I was forced to deal with my toxic wastedump of a family again.

My mother hated my 'wife' and mother inlaw. She resented me for not being there to help with my father. (Yeah fuck you too bitch.) When he first took ill. Mm. She made no secret of that in how she treated me.

In the amidst of all that my grandmother, one who helped raise me...and also swept the abuse under the rug. Died.

When I finally confronted my mother and aunt...my aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me. So the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity. The rage I had came back two fold.

Luckily I lived across town. I could be there for my dad...help get him to this appointments and visit...yet I was isolated enough that I didn't have to deal with the excess family shit I tried to escape.

Until 2020.

In this godawful hellscape of a year... I lost my uncle in july. He was one of two male rolemodels I had. He helped instill morals in me and helped raise me.

I lost my house(A rental), because the phrase 'caregiver' went in one ear and out the other. My priority was my dad. So sometimes the lawn wouldn't be cut as often as they would like. Or sometimes the house wouldn't be as clean. Sorry I have priorities. The shitbag landlord told us the neighborhood was becoming gentrified and he wouldn't be renewing our lease at the end of the year.

So unpleasantly I had to move back home with my wife and mother in law. Where my mother finds fault in everything.

Lovely.

A month after I move in my father dies.

Its at this juncture I begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything. I could not, in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel. I thought I'd get another year with him. Instead I got a middle finger.

A week or so before his birthday.

Then the petty fights started over bullshit. They are too numerous to even bother recounting here. Everyday some minor drama.

As if that wasn't enough... One of the kittens I hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer. After I spent 350 dollars I didn't fucking have to try and save her life. It wasn't my cat though. It was my dads. So another kick in the nuts.

This has been my life for the last three months. One blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags. Fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about.

The cat dying was the last straw for me. I went off my meds. I was tried of playing peace keeper or being 'the man of the house.'

If I'm going to be miserable, I'm going to be miserable. I'm not going to keep pumping chemical bullshit into me to give me an artificial happy only to have it destroyed by selfish ignorant fucks.

TO make matters worse, the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she doesn't want to do anything. So cleaning, the litterboxes all of it falls on me now. This enviroment is destroying  the one healthy relationship I have. I'm growing to hate her too.

Oh did I mention I'm a firearm owner? I had to stay away from them for years until I trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again. The entire experience has destroyed that. I can't even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and I shared.

Years of healing unraveled in a few short months.

I'm a prisoner inside my own mind(And home it feels like)  half the time and the other half Well....I'm getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like I'm still a child because apperently I'm supposed to ask permission before leaving.. HAHAHA No.

I've just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit. Though don't mistake me. I'm far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself. See if I opt out of this, the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds. That thought alone makes me smile.

I find myself looking at my dad's 1911 which I carry everyday...wondering why I don't stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger.

Even at my lowest I used to have reasons why I wouldn't. Now the reasons why I should vastly out weigh the reasons why I shouldn't.

Now that I have the text here, looking at it... I suppose the only reason I haven't is I'm not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me. The way this shitfuck of a year has gone I'd survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than I already am.  There's always the shotgun I suppose...but it doesn't have the same sense of poetic irony to it.

So yeah. Merry Christmas to me.

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone.

I don’t think I can do this anymore. Everywhere I go, it all feels so grey. I’d often try to make myself upset, because at least it was a feeling in and of itself.  Objectively speaking, my life's been great. I’ve had a plethora of friends and romantic partners, I’ve had nothing short of an amazing, loving, and dedicated family. So why do I feel so empty inside? Why is it that I can clearly remember the last time I felt true happiness? A random fleeting moment outside of a gym in 2017, it was but a fleeting moment, but I felt as if a warm cascade blanketed my soul, I felt a feeling of positive emotion radiate through me. It may have only lasted seconds, but it was sobering. It showed me what I lacked, no matter how hard I tried, that feeling never came back. It would be appropriate to say I’ve thought about suicide for quite a long time. The cold sinking feeling that stands your hair on end, the feeling of being sucked into a bottomless void of negative emotion. It felt comforting, because I felt something.  My life isn’t a prototypical tragedy, its just devoid of a fundamental element of what a life should consist of. I’d probably be more satisfied if I had a better reason to do this, sometimes I long for a tragic life as a justification for my suffering. 

I truly am defective.

To my friends and family: It should go without saying that this isn’t your fault. You could have never known. No, you shouldn’t of reached out, I didn’t want the help. Please, don’t blame yourselves. I have no interest in psychiatric treatment, I’ve read a multitude of papers on the efficacy or lack thereof when it comes to pharmacological treatments along with their intolerability. Despite being unable to register the feeling, objectively I know I was loved, and for that, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry I couldn’t stick around any longer, I just can’t imagine decades more of this. 

I hereby leave all of my belongings and finances to the whim of my Mother, Father, and Sibling.

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month."

918,I got raped and nobody believes me,ukim2d,infj2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ukim2d/i_got_raped_and_nobody_believes_me/,462,SuicideWatch,True,"I'm a man despite the way that sounds I guess. I got raped in Japan after being heavily drugged and sedated by some guy I thought was my friend. I have an autism spectrum disorder (Aspergers) and very few people take me seriously because of my lack of emotive properties and reasons I don't totally understand.

Guess I had a fairly normal childhood, aside from being molested being my first memory (separate from the rape as an adult). My parents never got along, and one night through the vent that I always listened to (i liked the sound of the pipes and water), I heard my mother talking to my father. She said that I creeped her out and that she didn't love me and felt bad about it. My Dad was silent for awhile and said that was horrible, but admitted he didn't love me either and they both laughed. It took years for me to process what that meant, but they never hugged me, praised me or even really cared to speak with me. I didn't and still don't understand why.

I got married to a woman that I thought loved me, and I was unable to consummate the marriage frequently due to being raped and molested earlier in my life. She eventually cheated on me while w were married and left me for my friend that she cheated on me with. It hurt a lot, and I really don't feel like dealing with the constant pain anymore.

I feel like I cannot trust anyone, that nobody really understands or cares to understand me. The only person that ever hugged me was the man who raped me in Japan.

I guess if I could pick one thing to be different, I would have tried to make love to my wife and find someone that love me the way I loved them, and then maybe I would have been happy. Or if I had parents that had cared about me, maybe I wouldn't have ended up as some autistic freakshow."

I desire suicide.",cpy5ew,SaltyBizkitt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cpy5ew/it_will_get_better_being_the_biggest_lie_ive_been/,459,SuicideWatch,False,"I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now.

925,My Wife Attempted Suicide,vliro3,justsomedude1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vliro3/my_wife_attempted_suicide/,456,SuicideWatch,False,"Wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. She texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said ""Goodbye. I'm sorry."" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be ""brain dead"" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there's nothing we can do here. She's in ICU, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children. I am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early May, every day, and I'm not responding to any treatment. My head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. I'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I've been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a ""suicide watch"" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven't heard from her since. I'm lost. I'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than I've ever been in my entire life. And my head is banging...just pounding. I asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all I've been doing is crying, then I stop and get so mad...just furious. Then I break down again. I talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. But I'm so, so broken. I'm so confused. What did I do to make this happen? I just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what I'm going to when she comes home. I've never been so scared of something in my life. What if she does this again? What about the kids? They're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. What if they find something really wrong with my brain? I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later I'm going to fall. And everyone is depending on me. And for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said ""Goodbye. I'm sorry."" Where the hell do we even go from here?"

Maybe 30 minutes later we pronounced him dead.  But his body is still trying to breath after we shut off the vent.  Could palpate a carotid pulse.  So I hooked the BVM up to his ET tube while the resident called the trauma attending back.  We tried again but called time of death (again) like 10-20 minutes later.

He was a beautiful young man.  I mean, other than the gun shot wound to his temple.  But it just made me think.  About that moment.  When the idea becomes reality.  What is it that makes someone think that this is my only way out?

I’ve been thinking more about it, lately.  In general, before this morning.  What would I do.  What would others think or say.  

I feel trapped.  I can’t possibly express this to anyone.  How could you?  How could anyone possibly understand?

I completed 6+ years individual therapy (ongoing), group therapy, hypnotherapy, intensive outpatient program, partial hospitalization, rehabilitation, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, internal family systems, holistic treatment, multiple medications, ketamine therapy, the public psych ward, meditation, exercise, diet, journaling and recently 36 rounds of deep TMS, I got multiple painful laser treatments on my self-harm scars.

What more do people expect me to do? I tried choosing life for a long time. I have no regrets. Why keep trying to live longer? My death is inevitable either way. 

By finally choosing death, I can live out the rest of my days peacefully, no longer battling for my life every waking second.

UPDATE EDIT (a long letter, but also a response to everyone who has unexpectedly reached out):

Someone deleted a comment saying I’d be committing “murder” and it’s an “immoral act.” If you die by suicide, you are not doing anything immoral. You are not a murderer. You died from an illness. Depression is called the “silent killer” for a reason. Many, many- too many- people worldwide die from suicide daily. I am not supporting anyone else to die by suicide, merely expressing my own personal thoughts- and perhaps people who can unfortunately relate to me, can find solace & feel less alone realizing I am fighting this battle with them, hearing their own similar feelings reflected in the void.

We must do tremendously better to help those ailing from mental illness, a sickness primarily devastating the most important organ of the human body, the brain.

No matter what, I will advocate for the de-stigmatization of mental health. Telling someone suicidal that they are justifying an “immoral murder” casts further shame, alienation and gross misunderstanding + oversimplification upon a serious illness. 

Educate yourself and please avoid using someone’s personal pain & suffering to have a debate on your projected willfully ignorant “morality.” I’ve been condemned to “go straight to hell” when I was a child, by my own father, for feeling suicidal. I’ve heard it all. For fellow people battling mental health issues, you are strong. I know from personal experience, society attacks those with mental illness. It’s like kicking a dog that’s already down x1000, and it’s pathetic how others can condescend, judge and mistreat those with mental health issues. I know we already feel worse than anyone could ever imagine. 

I appreciate anyone who greets this post with empathy & thoughtfulness. 

But if you want to preach at me, ask yourself: why are you the kind of person who wants to criticize and condemn someone in extreme pain? Are you a sadist? Ask yourself about your own unhealed issues and why a stranger’s suicidal feelings gives you the urge to name them a “murderer” and “immoral,” etc, ask yourself why you attempt passing personal judgment on their soul? 

Although I battle suicidal ideation 24/7, I hold no hatred in my heart for others, no self-righteousness, and understand everyone is fighting their own personal battle, and I am not so egocentric as to think I can condemn & judge those suffering in their mental health. 

My greatest strength is empathy; I hear and see everyone who is offering help in some way. You are good souls. I am so empathetic I believe the person calling me a “murderer” was trying to help in their own twisted way, they just aren’t educated on mental health issues. I thank everyone who has responded with good intentions. You do make a difference- if you hold such empathy for a mere stranger on reddit, I am sure your loved ones are blessed by your presence in their lives. If my post upsets you in any way, I suggest avoiding this subreddit if you feel fragile. Please protect yourself- you deserve healthy boundaries, including on the internet."

948,My boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day.,afo6tb,kaykay101111,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/afo6tb/my_boyfriend_comes_from_3_generations_of_suicide/,444,SuicideWatch,False,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up. 

I have no fucking purpose to live. I understand why her Dad left. I want to leave also. "

Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me."

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.

I’m not going to say what it is, but if you really want to know, my post history is right there. It shouldn’t be very hard to figure out. 

Because of this deformity, I’ve faced more than my fair share of persecution. I have a hard time even getting out of bed in the morning or doing the most menial of tasks such as brushing my teeth or getting changed. It’s a miracle how I’m still maintaining good grades in college after two years, but that’s just because I’m trying to stave off the inevitable disappointment to my family.

I found a community on Reddit for people who suffer the same problem as me, and I finally thought I found a place where I’d fit in. So I made an account and finally confessed all the things that I’d never say in public for fear of being ostracized even further than I already am. And I did indeed fit in. For about three months.

Last night, things came to a head. In the midst of a years-long ongoing battle with depression, while many thoughts were going through my stupid head, I expressed my wish for those of us with this particular issue to be able to seek assisted suicide if we so choose, because I can’t do this shit anymore.

Well, I probably should thought that through, because now I’m banned from that subreddit forever. Doesn’t look I’m getting back in either. My one safe haven from persecution, gone.

Now I have nothing. Nothing and nobody to keep me sane and safe from this rotten world. No community. No friends. No significant other. Nothing.

This is my breaking point. I’m done here. I have no reason to keep using this app, and quite frankly, no reason to continue living at all if all I’m going to do is suffer, because that’s not much of a life.

I don’t have a shotgun, nor do I know where I would obtain one. But every day it becomes clearer to me that my fate will be my rotting, shit covered remains with half my face blown off, laying in a ditch, waiting to be reclaimed by nature. And that’s exactly how I want it to be."

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see."

A parent is irreplaceable. You are not just a role model or a supporting figure for your children, you are their spine, weather they know it or not. My father wasn’t just my dad. He was my best friend. The person I could talk to about anything. When my aunt and uncle told me he was gone and I took my phone out to start making arrangements I dialled his number out of habit.

I went from gf to gf and job to job since then and never found happiness.  in retrospective I'm less happy now that I'm alone but I also know that I cannot be with someone as I don't want to make anyone else miserable. Anyway, it really is tougher at night to be alone. sorry for the rambling, I guess I needed to write something instead of doing something dumb. anyone has a  song suggestion or something like that when you are feeling even more shit than usual? sorry If I sounded whinny ugh."

I’ve been running on empty for years, just holding on in the hopes that one day it might get better. I took active steps to try to make that happen too.

But I was a fool. It’s never going to get better for me. I almost ended my life 4 years ago, but that choice was taken from me and I went to the hospital. If I knew what my life looked like now, I would have jumped. I’ve lost nearly everything. 

The person I loved the most, and my best friend of 10 years treats me like I don’t matter. I can tell she gave up on our friendship a long time ago, despite my efforts to change that. I have no family. None that cares anyway. My parents and my sister have abused me my entire life. I’ve lost my drive, and passion I had for anything, it’s just all gone. I feel like a shell of the person I once was.

This world is cruel. No one really cares about anyone or anything. I held on for as long as I could, but I just can’t do it anymore. I give up."

He had been down with girl problems, but nothing out of the ordinary to me. Her parents actually knew he was a risk for suicide, as they had him speaking with a therapist. But never told any of his family, and I worked with him every day. 

Saw him the night before at my youngest brothers wrestling dual and then I went home with my girlfriend. The next day I was late to work and when I got there he still hadn’t showed. Began to get worried once no one could contact him for an hour. So I went out looking for him thinking he me have just been taking the day off or even doing another chore. I saw his truck in a field where we run our cows. It had several inches of snow on it meaning it had been there for a while. I drove out to him as fast as I could, but I slowed down before I got to him because I didn’t want to look crazy if he was alright. I saw him from the back of his truck thinking he may have been sleeping. Got to the window and saw how pale his hands were, looked up and saw the blood coming out of his ear. 

I had to call 911, then my entire family to deliver the news. It’s been 8 months and i am beginning to slip into a severe depression and even noticing dark thoughts slipping into my mind and in-convinces. It’s like suicide is a disease and I contracted it from being exposed to him. 

I miss him dearly. He was amazing. A light in my life. He would have pulled through and been so much happier now. He just came across a dark time and no one, I wasn’t there for him. Please look out for your loved ones. Some people hide the pain."

I cannot continue this journey to nowhere. I’ve realized that there is no longer any way for me to circumvent the insurmountable sadness I feel.

Something finally snapped or clicked, or whatever. But I wrote out the note, counted out the pills to make sure there were enough, and just… stopped. I felt nothing. Where before was deep depression and dark, twisted tights, there was just nothing. And then I thought about my roommates finding my body. And my boyfriend losing another person in his life. And my cat. And I just couldn't do it. I couldn't hurt everyone like that. I don't know why these people care about me, but they do, and I don't have the strength to hurt them. But now, 20 minutes after I put the pills back and put the bottle out of sight, 15 minutes after I hid away the note in my notebook, all the emotions have come back like a flood. Only this time, they're mixed with a deep loathing for myself for getting so close. For threatening to harm my friends and loved ones like that. And for still ruminating on actually following through tomorrow. I probably won't. I don't want to cause pain to others. I just want mine to stop. It won't, though. It never will. I've been on dozens of meds for over 15 years, been in and out of a dozen different psych wards in three different states, been through 8 on and off years of therapy. I don't feel like I've made any real progress. I'm so tired of it all. I just want it to end. But I can't do that. Not yet. I'm sure one day they'll give up on me, like everyone before them. And then I'll be free to end this misery. Quietly and alone, where no one else gets hurt. Just thought I'd say something to someone. It feels better than holding it in forever."

1043,How do I get over the fact that most people objectively can't/won't understand me?,w3jl99,Markipt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w3jl99/how_do_i_get_over_the_fact_that_most_people/,4,SuicideWatch,False,"Everyone's had moments where they've thought no one understands them at least on something at some point I'm sure, but what do you do when that's simply true for everything about you? Statistically speaking there are very few people who would even have a basic understanding of me on a base identity level. I'm genderfluid- that automatically places me in a position where while almost everyone else has an entire half of the population to relate to at least a little, I don't. I have less than 1%, and even then most people I've met, seen, or even heard of have a very different experience to mine when it comes to gender identity. Most people in the world don't even believe I'm real, and most (not an exaggeration when I say most) believe I deserve to be tortured and denied a genuine life. 

I've grown up in a situation where I've been tossed back and forth between the two extremes of being completely devoid of personal autonomy, to being expected to succeed with no trustworthy guidance.   I was never allowed to grow up and now that I'm at a place where I have a little more control over my own life, I'm too broken to move forward effectively. I'm isolated from peers in a much worse way than physical distance was. I can't relate to anyone my age and it's meant the only way I can have any semblance of support in my life is by feigning an identity that makes me more likeable. None of it ever feels real but I'm too hurt to handle all the rejection that constantly comes whenever I begin to open up with my real self. I can't handle being alone.

So many wayward experiences have taken place in my life and my identity itself is one no one has ever understood no matter how well I attempt explaining. I've never felt seen in my entire life to any significant extent, and it honestly doesn't feel like I ever will be. People don't understand what it's like to have never had any mentors in your life at all. To never have had any trusted person stay trusted for more than a moment. I've been used so much my whole life and I'll never get to experience being allowed to be vulnerable without being hurt further. Broken love hurts so much more when love at all is so scarce in your life. I have no support to fall back on. Being suicidal is the only source of encouragement to go on I have because it gives me peace of mind at that the very least no matter how much I'm hurt again and again I can always just end it all. It used to be at least. I just want someone to understand me once in my life. I want someone to know me and actually put any effort into really knowing me. I'm tired of going so far for everyone because I'm desperate for any scrap of affection and then being let down the moment I start believing ""this will be different I can trust them to be good this time."" I don't have what it takes to be one of those people that just don't care. I care so much about everything and because of that I can't handle existing when no one else in the entire world knows or loves me back. I'm so tired of trying so hard and failing more. It doesn't matter what I think of myself when no one else sees it. No matter how much I know myself to be genuine and someone worth something when literally no one else in the entire world has ever seen that why does that matter at all what I think? I'm tired of trying to be loved for myself. Maybe if I leaned more into a lie I'd at least have some care even if it wasn't totally real. Maybe who I am just wasn't meant to be in this world. I just don't know if it's all worth living in here when I never get any good moments. I've been apathetic to life and suicidal since I was literally 4 years old. It's been a long time and I still haven't found an actual reason to live other than waiting for one. I don't know if it's worth waiting anymore."

I've received multiple DMs asking me if I want to be their girlfriend and even more pressuring me to send them nudes. All after they read a post about how much I want to die.


Since I was a little kid, I only ever got sexual/romantic attention, no one wanted to be friends with me, but I'd het sexually assaulted on a regular basis and people begging me to be their girlfriend.

Online too, whenever I finally think I made an online friend, turns out they just wanted me to send them nudes the whole time. And because of past trauma that fucks with my mentality: I'm super easy to manipulate and convince too. They know this and take advantage of it.

So yeah, I'm basically just a glorified sex doll, really does wonders for my self-worth. My only purpose in life is to get groomed by creeps on the internet and stalked by them in real life too. I'm not safe anywhere, makes me wonder if I'm doing something wrong.

Why do I exist if this is all my life is supposed to be? Is it punishment for something I did?"

I haven't decided on how to do it yet. I'm researching, I guess I have enough energy for that. 

I have a lot to offer the world, a lot I wanted to do. But the early stages of life have been unkind to me. If only. Adults keep letting me down and I don't know what I can do now. I feel powerless, helpless and defeated.

Today while on a drive I went to swerve into a tree but then I thought I'm not going fast enough and sped up to well over the speed limit, I didn't end up going into a tree and slowed down. About 30 minutes ago I pressed a pair of box cutters to my wrist. I'm not sure what my intentions were, suicide, wanting to inflict pain, wanting to feel something I don't know. I feel very uncomfortable talking to my family about any of this stuff their advice is pretty terrible. All I want to do is run away, I love to travel and I hate my life where I am. Unfortunately I am still in high school and have little money so I can't do that. This all has a very large impact on my schoolwork, I get good grades but my parents don't think I try hard enough. It's so hard for me, very rarely I feel sort of happy and I can sit down and do work but for the rest of the time I'm wallowing in my own sadness. Sometimes I sit down and get drunk by myself to feel better. I know it's not good but I don't really know what to do. I often feel like I'm going insane. I sit on the train and have weird daydreams, like demonic nightmare shit. I have vivid imaginations of my life in the future, mostly the same but I live on my own and then at some point I kill myself."

And it really wasn't any better.My family called me a liar and crazy and said I lied on my mom about everything. She left me with Trama and my siblings without a mom. Nobody comforted me these past couple months after the funeral I didn't hear from anyone I live on my own and do everything for myself. I have no friends or family I mean nothing to no one I've been alone since a child and continue to be. I met this boy about a week after her funeral and he lied and said he wanted a relationship but just used me for my body. My 3 little ""friends"" I thought I had around that time they left when I explained how I needed more support. My grandma has custody of my 3 siblings all under the age of 12. She and I don't have a good relationship she kicked me out 2 weeks after my 18th over a phone but she been plotting on kicking me out since I got with her honestly. She pulled me away from
My moms casket when we went to view the body and then comforted my moms boyfriend but never once the whole process did she hug me like that. She also rushed me when she took me to clean out her house or get a few items. I've been dealing with both the deaths alone and the Trama that happened following it. No I'm not going to go do more therapy I've had therapist on top of therapist since I was 14 (10 all together) talking shit out doesn't help.

I am a failure at everything. I have no talents in music, art, writing, or just anything. I joined a debate club and got my ass stomped because I fucking suck at making an argument. I can't even have an argument against a rando on the internet without getting ganged up on. And that is only the beginning. I was born a mistake, I wasn't supposed to exist, but I loved my parents dearly, and when I lost my dad at seven years old, I was devastated, and was driven into deep depression, and I have been struggling since then, and of course my new dad was in the military, so about two years later we had to move to North Virginia, basically ripping me away from all of my family except for my parents. And North Virginia was absolutely hell. Everyone hated everyone. The kids in my school didn't make friends, they used you as tools, and when they have you on the ropes, they cut it and brag to the other kids. I didn't have friends for 5-6ish years and was consistently bullied for being depressed. And the neighbors were incredibly mean, I am guessing because of our skin color, since they only treated the few white people in the neighborhood like garbage, consistent glares from adults, the kids would just stare at you. around that time, I started getting into the media, only to find out the nation I love, was one of the most hated countries, even by its own people. And that also extended to the American people. And when I try to defend my nation, all I get is a bunch of hate. Nobody outside of my country likes me, not even my own people like me. With the current media, it feels like I always have a target on my back, because I am the literal definition of what everyone I speak to hates. I am white, a male, and have Christian and Republican values. So, what is the point? If I die, nobody will care, I may devastate my family, but at least I would be making some people happy for the first time, those people being the ones who want my lynched.

\*Edit: I did move out of Virginia, but I still struggle to make friends, since my high school makes sure you don't end up with people from the previous classes from the first half of the year, especially if you are friends. (We have A half and B half of the year)"

I'm posting because I very much want to cut myself. The last time I felt like that I got closer than ever to taking it further.

I know I would have to take 500mg to securely kill me, but is it 100% true that it will definetly kill me? Or should I take like 600mg so I will definetly die?

My next question is, could I take this dosage nasaly? Cause I hate iv but I know that I would have to take more if I snort it. And could my nose handle that much anyway?

And would it hurt in any way possible? I heard that I would die bcause I would't  breath enough and stuff like that, but then heroin stops physical pain so would I feel it anyway?

And how exactly would it feel? I know how an opiat high feels but that high dosage must feel much stronger, so would it feel like i am in heaven or something like that or would I even feel anything at all? And would I forget that I would die anyway or would I still be scared. It would be awesome if I could forget my whole problems before death.

The next question is if I could mix it with ecstasy? Cause I love the high of ecstasy and the pain after that wouldn't matter if I would die anyway. So if that works should I take the heroin directly after I took the ecstasy or some thime after for the best effect? ANd how exactly would it feel then?

And now the most important question, how long after taking the heroin would it take me to die? Cause my plan would be to take it when my mother and friends sleep so I would die before them knowing, cause if they would see it they would bring me to the hospital and that would be like hell. They have different sleeping schedules, but there are like 4 hours in which everyone is asleep and definetly they wouldn't look after me. But at max I would have 6 hours, so would that work in that time?

And before anyone comments that this is selfish, my family abuses me anyway."

I just want someone to listen.,w3kyxy,discussionoise,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w3kyxy/please_help_me_i_just_want_someone_to_listen/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I've had suicidal thoughts every couple months since college. I was put on a 5150 hold last year. I'm 28 and graduated from law school in 2020. The bar was delayed until October and bar prep courses all went online. I'm the type of person who's very bad at keeping myself on track, and I ended up procrastinating on studying and eventually failing. I was supposed to retake it in February but had my application administratively due to a missing form. It was a separate notice about remote testing protocols that I was supposed to sign, but I didn't notice it until 1 day after the deadline passed. The bar administrators didn't reinstate my application. I was fired by my firm after telling them about it. I tried retaking in the summer and failed again for similar reasons. I couldn't take the exam after that because of exposure to COVID.

I was so excited to finally have my life together after graduating from law school. I was 26 and had a 6-figure job ready, a plan to pay off my loans, and I was happy and healthy. Now I'm 28, I've been jobless since I was fired, and I still haven't passed the bar. I've lost contact with my friends because I was so embarrassed about my situation that I got rid of my social media. I gained a ton of weight and am in terrible shape physically. My apartment is a complete mess. 

My next retake is in 6 days and I'm not prepared at all. Every time I think ""I should be studying right now,"" I get stressed and do something else to distract myself, like going on YouTube or playing video games. Then time passes and before I realize it, it feels like it's too late. I hate that I'm like this. When I was in school or working, I was always extremely responsible, but everything falls apart when I'm on my own and I don't feel like anyone is relying on me for anything.

I called a suicide hotline earlier and the person I talked to just lectured me on mindfulness and told me I should find a therapist because the people there are only volunteers. I'm already taking medication for depression and anxiety. I don't have the resources for anything else.

I can't stop thinking about how I went from having everything I wanted to having nothing.   I really hate the person I am now. I don't know how I'm going to get a job after being unemployed for over a year. Even if I miraculously pass the bar this time and find a firm willing to hire me, I'd be a first year associate who's almost 29. It feels like I should be an adult and I'm not. I'm so far behind that I just want to quit and start over. The only reason I've managed to stay alive is because I'm a coward who's too scared to try any painful suicide methods. The one time I drove myself to a bridge to try to drown, I couldn't jump. I feel so pathetic. I don't know how I'm going to be able to fix my life."

On top of that I'm also juggling fucking arthritis, endometriosis, and a painfully itchy skin condition that is flaring up in this awful cold weather.

No matter what I focus on I never seem to be doing it right or balancing my priorities properly. I keep making stupid mistakes because I can barely focus on anything and I'm just told I'm lazy or careless.

I don't see myself being able to afford housing security for a long time and have been either rejected or beaten on every single rental application over the past two months despite having an excellent income and rental history. 

Society seems to be getting worse every day and we're staring at an inevitable global crisis that makes life not worth living. 

Lifeline didn't help me, my expensive psychologist didn't help me, my work's EAP didn't help me, my antidepressants barely work any more.

If it wasn't for my precious parrot giving me loving kisses and cute little stares with his beady brown eyes,  I would have probably offed myself already, but I can't stand the idea of upsetting him or my loved ones.

I've been experimenting with small SH on hideable places so I can up my pain tolerance in preparation and hide from my partners. I'm so fucking tired and a rest from life sounds so tempting. Do I even bother?"

If it were an option that I could choose, I would just quit. I would just stop. But it's not. Killing myself is an active, conscious thing and it's not as simple as just ceasing to continue. I hate life. So much. There's not even anything I can do to make it more manageable. The only way that this can get better is by me dying.

The biggest reason I'm doubting taking this route is because I'm scared that if it comes out I'm even further from home. Also how does it work with work and stuff. Do you just take vacation days 😅 (I'm sure this is different per country but still).

Speaking of social ineptitude, my social life is also a wreck. I can't keep a friend to save my life because I can't carry a conversation or keep others' needs in mind. My chronic pain issues also come into play here, as I can't go everywhere I want to go and making IRL friends feels like a no-go.

Respectfully, I don't see the point in living anymore. It feels like all I do is sit in my dirty ass room alone, not talking to anyone even over the internet, and consume worthless media to numb the boredom and literal pain. Some weeks it feels like the only thing I have left to live for is the next episode or entry in the franchise. No one talks to me. I have no future. Even my dad is starting to hate me.

And to make it all worse, I haven't been able to take psychiatric medications in well over a year because the side effects worsen my chronic pain issue (effectively making me even more suicidal).

These are all warning signs and I called the people on my safety list, next is the suicide hotline or my medical professional. I don’t want to call and I just want to sleep but I will probably do something I shouldn’t and then I’ll feel even worse. I tried to pray and I still want to die. 

I also have so much to lose if I do something drastic like go to the hospital, get institutionalized.. I might lose my job, my job is definitely not secure and my girlfriend doesn’t know how bad I get and I wanted her to never know. Who wants to date a person like me.. I’m sick, in many ways. I want to make everyone happy and that makes me worse.

This seems like a crazy title and a crazy thing to think. Oh why did he hill himself, oh because he over promised and then felt like he couldn’t deliver so instead of figuring it out he took his own life.. I mean on top of that I have other guilt and shame, I feel like the worse person in the world. 

It’s funny we were talking about feeling that way tonight at a meeting so I know I’m not alone but for some reason that is not enough. It’s not enough to not be alone and people can relate, I’m still not being honest and it’s killing me. But still I can’t be honest because then someone might give up on me.

Here I am now feeling absolutely miserable every morning when I have to wake up to go to work. I feel like crying at the thought of going to work. I even feel like it’d be better if I took my life just to escape working in general.

I feel like no matter what job I have, I’ll always be miserable and I’ll want to end my life instead of going through that suffering. No job really interests me so I feel like it’ll suck anyways. At least if I’m not alive, I won’t have to endure this suffering any longer."

I have not been happy most of my life as I have had so much terrible shit happen to me, but now I feel I am at my lowest. I am 21 and live with my grandmother who has taken care of me and my brother since 2013 and she is currently going through lung cancer and will not be here much longer. Day by day goes by and I have to watch her suffer and slowly be consumed by this horrible disease. It's been hard on everyone living in my house, and I hate having to watch this happen to her.

Not long ago I also did something to a friend I've had on the internet for many years that hurt her very badly. I sat in a call with her for nearly three hours apologizing over and over again as I cried my eyes out. She told me that it was okay and that she forgave me for what I did. Cut to a few days later she started to act as if she did not want to speak with me, as she would give one word responses to my Snapchat texts and would read them and not respond. I decided that she probably wanted a break from me so I waited a week and then we started to talk again. I began to realize I hurt her much more than she was letting on and started wishing she would have told me the truth that she was hurt, but I think she did not want to make me feel bad.

Last night at around 3 am I was feeling worse than I ever have felt before. I was feeling like I wanted to die and just get out of my pathetic life and be at peace finally. I contacted my friend through Snapchat and asked to talk to her as I was scared for my well being. She blew me off. I then told her again I really needed someone to talk with at that moment and then she blew me off again. A few minutes later, I saw she blocked me. I realized shortly after checking other accounts she blocked me on everything and I have no way to talk to her again as of now, asides from calling her phone or texting her which I do not want to do right now. I broke into tears, realizing my friendship with one of my best friends of many years was now probably over for good. All because of me screwing everything up.

I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to lose my grandma, I don't want to lose one of my best friends because of a terrible mistake, I don't want to suffer anymore and live my terrible life. I just want to be at peace."

I’m not sad I’m just not happy, bored I guess. But I’m tired of the stress and the work. 

My dream is to move to Montana it always has been. It’s such a beautiful part of the US and I just love the idea of owning a small ranch in the mountains and riding horses all day and fishing.

Honestly though I don’t think my life will get that far. Lately I’ve been getting the idea of just spending all of my money flying out to Montana and finding a beautiful view on a mountain and enjoy it for awhile and then kill myself.

I don’t know how I would but I’ve had a few ideas, shooting myself, hanging myself, jumping, etc. 

It’s not a concrete plan but I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t care about my health very much. And my thinking is that if smoking or drinking (which I do excessive amounts of both) gets in the way of my health, then it’s fine cause I could always just kill myself.

My friends have noticed that I care less about my health, they’ve all made comments about how I’m drinking wayyy too much and smoking cigarettes too much too. But I just don’t care because I don’t think I’ll live past 30 anyway

I’m only 18 but I’m just so exhausted right no. So tired of putting on a smile everyday. And I feel like Im putting a bad name to those with actual mental illnesses because I don’t think I have depression but I’m just kind of tired. 

I’ve gone through a lot in my life, my dad was an abusive alcoholic and the rest of my family moved to get away from him. And I guess I’m always scared I’ll end up like him. But I don’t think that’s the reason I want to end things. I really just am tired.

Everything is hopeless for me now and I just want to end it. I want out of this pain. But at the same time, I just can't bring myself to attempt suicide. So much holds me back. My family holds me back. Especially when it is almost my mom and brothers birthday. My friends and hell even my pets hold me back. Everyone wants something from me. I have duties and of course I do get survival instincts. I hate this feeling. I am just sitting in the middle with not wanting to die yet I have fucking will to live. Not how everything my life has been. My life is such a waste and I wish it was different. I wasted so much of my life and I wish I didn't spend it with trauma and being lazy from depression and other mental health issues. I am pathetic. I don't even know if I want to die.

Speaking up about the people who've abused me never turns out good for me. 
When I was little, I would try to get help from other adults whenever our parents were abusing my siblings and/or me. My parents would always tell that adult that I was just seeking attention or that I was making it up and sometimes that person would start abusing me too whenever they came around and my parents would just laugh at me.

I'm an adult now, and I don't live near any of them anymore, but they still try and act like they gave me everything and that my siblings and I had a great childhood.

I was raped by a partner nearly 10 years ago this December. I wouldn't let anyone touch me for 3 years after that. None of my friends believed me that I had been raped. My ex thought I was making it up so I wouldn't have to perform any sexual acts for him. So he lied about being raped so he could have it all about himself and what he wanted. (I know he lied because his last girlfriend told me herself, that he had lied about that to ""get back at me"".)

I'm with a better person now. They treat me better but their mom did some fucked up shit to me. I can't go into details without revealing who they are. But MIL put me in a dangerous situation by gaslighting me and manipulating me to go along with a situation I was calling cap on because she said ""we need to help keep them alive"", making it sound like they were suicidal too. (IDK if they are or not, but this person legally can't be responsible for themselves)

That person almost got me killed because of their actions and being heavily mentally unstable. There was an accident that I am still trying to recover from that has left me sick for the last 13 months, without that person being held accountable for causing it. However, my MIL tried to shift the blame of her actions onto my SIL and accusing her of being the "" conductor"" behind it all, despite my SIL not really being involved besides being supportive of me. Now MIL and FIL are saying I am pushing my image of my mother onto MIL, which isn't true, and that I have false memories from the incident so they can't be trusted. But I don't have false memories and haven't told them anything directly from me about the accident. I was just trying to hold them accountable for their involvement and for lying to me. And now it feels like they convinced my SIL that I made the part up about MIL blaming her when I know she did.

All of this has stressed me out horribly to the point that I've wanted to unalive myself several times because no matter what I say or do, no one listens or believes me. 

I just want this pain to stop. I've thought about doing it at home or just taking myself to the river with some rocks or diving off a bridge. The only reason I haven't so far is because I don't want to hurt my partner. It's just really f*cking hard right now not to do it and end it because I am so tired of fighting for myself with no one listening to me."

I just have been watching those silly youtube shorts of reddit posts lately. One struck me really hard as a lot of the root cause of my distress, the one post about the transgender ftm guy talking about male loneliness. The idea that I live in a society that is naturally hostile to me.

I have come to the terms that I hate being a man, I hate it a lot, and it isn’t that I want to be female or nonbinary, I don’t want to put a label on myself. I want to be seen as me (21M), the person I am, and not anyone else. However, maybe this is trying to divert blame, I take a lot of responsibility on why I am lonely. I deleted all my social media awhile ago, for a multitude of reasons.

I see all of my worth only equating to my accomplishments, I do well in most things. Career-wise I am fine, but socially I am falling apart. I don’t know what I do wrong, I do have snapchat after I learned no one my age texts anymore. I try to text people regularly and reach out to them, but no one ever reaches out to me.

I have gone a year before without talking ti any family, and the only person I had was my roommate. We are best friends, and he cares about me, he got a girlfriend recently though and has started to become distracted with her. I am happy for him, I truly love him and I wish them the best he deserves a long happy life.

It isn’t even standard romantic love that I want, I just want that unconditional love that I have lost entirely. I want companionship and people to smile with. Sorry if the message isn’t exactly coherent, I am kinda rambling about many of my problems at once with small tidbits.

I want a family someday, I want to be happy and to be loved for who I am not as someone with tons of labels or based on external things. I fear though, and I feel pretty certain, that I will never find anyone. I don’t want to kill myself although I contemplate it a lot. But I strive to die before I am 27.

I am 25f, live with my husband of 7 years and our 2 dogs. He has been such a rock to me our entire relationship. I struggle with mental health issues and have been extremely unstable basically the whole time we’ve been together. I’ve been on and off the wagon multiple times. 

I spiral into deep depressions where I can’t even really register that he’s a real person, I can’t hold down a job, sometimes I can’t get out of bed at all and when I do, I just start crying. But no matter what happens, he holds me and tells me everything is okay and that he loves me, makes me drink water and watches a movie with me. Sometimes I get so angry for no reason and I yell at him, I throw tantrums like a child and I can’t control myself. 

It isn’t fair to him. I went through so much trauma when I was a kid, and I feel like I’ll never get to function like a real human being. I haven’t left my house in months because I’m terrified of everything. He works full time, takes care of me and the dogs, does all the shopping. 

I feel like I’ll never be able to work through any of my trauma or get the help I need. I’ve been thinking the past few days that maybe he would be better off without me. I don’t know how much longer I can keep spiraling, then climbing back out, only to realize the good days are only ever because I’m pretending to be someone else, and then I spiral again. My dogs deserve a better mom. 
My husband deserves someone who can be a real partner. 

I’ve pushed my family away for so long I don’t have anyone. I’ve pushed all of my friends away to the point that they don’t answer me when I text them or pick up when I call. 

There is a gun in the house, and I can’t bring myself to even ask my husband to hide it from me because I feel selfish and he’ll think I’m just being dramatic or I’ll worry him. I put him through so much. 
I don’t have health insurance and I can’t afford to see a doctor. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to stop feeling this deep pit of emptiness inside of me. Even if I try, I’ll just end up here again eventually. 

We wanted to have kids, but those kids would deserve better than me. Everything would be easier for everyone if I just stopped living, stopped being such a burden. 

I don’t know if I’m looking for encouragement or support. I just don’t have anyone else to tell all of this to. I feel so stupid even typing this, because it’s such a terrible summation of all the things in my heart. All of these horrible memories that pop into my head constantly every day, all of these fears and anxieties that everyone else seems to think are simple but keep me from being able to just walk my dogs. 

I’m sorry I’m being so emotional. I’ve been crying all day. Thank you for reading this, if you do."

It’s going to sit at my knees while im up against the closet door. I use a bungee cord that is meant for tarps and it has these balls on them to act as knots. Use like 5 of them, they come in 8,9 and 11 inches. Spread them out and then tie a short bungee cord to the doorknob and put the hooks of that bungee into the other ones, clamp the metal hooks in with pliers. With the 50lb weight, I’m using a bungee with a thicker radius and is flat instead of round. That wraps under the weight and up to my neck. So the idea is for the bungee on the door to tighten the ones around the neck and the bungee from the weight is to hold my neck down. So both forces are going in the same way as you lean forward you put the one through the weight over your neck which forces your neck into the bungees i tie around my neck which also get pulled from the door bungee. I think bungees are best because you can get that extra force and really lean into a comfortable position.

I've had these weird dreams/daydreams that feel like memories involving distinct identifiable people (a few of whom I know/knew in real-life but others that I don't), some weird cult called ""the Laws of Math"", 3 or 4 different women claiming they were my wife (who I think I've met in real-life but haven't seen for like 6 years), and a bunch of other random people working various jobs for some company (one of which looked like Bill Hader from Superbad but he was some kind of scientist). What's weird about all of these is that there seems to be a continuity to all the interactions, at least for some of them - but the trippy part is that I'm pretty sure I've woken up in my college apartment  on the same morning 1 year ago at least 3 times (maybe more but my brain is pretty much toast at this point so could be like 10+ for all I know). The sequence of events following that involves an intensifying sense of déja vu that gets worse as time progresses, eventually I move back into my parents house in my hometown after leaving college - with the night before the move and the day of loading the moving van feeling particularly familiar. At this point I can't tell what's even real anymore, or assuming this is somehow real and I'm not just losing my mind - why would I keep going back to the same point in time? Realistically if I could rewind time I would go back waaay earlier because I've been on the decline for like 7 years and have accomplished next to nothing over that time period. Previous runs of this have involved someone ringing my doorbell saying ""I have a contract"" when I answer, and then the memory gets foggy. I think the last time it was a cop (or someone dressed like one) who I recognized to be a childhood friend's mom - we briefly chatted and then someone else showed up, my mind froze and then I'm pretty sure I said something along the lines of ""send me back in time again my memory keeps getting wiped"". A couple of the times a similar situation played out with the cop, though in these cases I wasn't actually at the house since I live at my dad's apartment, I got a text from my mom saying a cop was at the house looking for me and then proceeded to head over there and it was the same cop as the previous time. I have no idea if I'm just tripping balls or not when it comes to this but honestly the déja vu has me pretty spooked and I'm kind of tempted to kill myself in order to make it stop since I'm constantly anticipating things at this point while my own life situation gets worse and worse and I don't really see the point in improving it just to end up dying in mediocrity anyways. At least the dreams/hallucinations provide the illusion that alternate realities exist since this one is a total dead-end. I swear everytime I post something on the internet the déja vu sensation is there, everything I do feels like something I've already done. I'm sick of this. I failed at basically everything I've attempted in life, I don't want to add suicide to that long list because things will be even worse if I manage to screw that one up. Society likes to talk about suicide awareness but unless you can provide utility to other people they don't really care if you do it. So I'm pretty much stuck between wanting to kill myself and wanting to kill other people because of the implied expectation that I'm supposed to be useful to them in order to experience any sort of sustained personal comfort in the few hours of remaining free time I have."

My son (20) recently got dumped by his horrible narcissistic girlfriend (23). He’s utterly heartbroken and inconsolable; wants her back at any cost - doesn’t want to go on without her! 

I’m a single dad and have raised him since he was 11. Since the breakup he has made two suicide attempts. He was sectioned under the Mental Health Act both times after I intervened and called emergency services before he could carry out his plans.

I love him so much and I tell him constantly how much he means to me! I’ve stayed by his side when he was in hospital listening to his troubles without judgment; just listening and trying to understand his problems and pain! All I think to do is hug him, kiss him and tell him how much I love him!

I’m wracked with guilt since I called EMS and he was forcibly sedated and restrained prior to being hospitalised. Everyone tells me I did the right thing - but I still feel like I’ve betrayed him!?

I’m absolutely exhausted emotionally and physically. We have always had a great relationship - he knows I’d NEVER do anything to hurt him. I had no choice but to call EMS, but I feel horrible about it (I’m crying privately as I write this). 

He’s now on antidepressants and is seeing a Dr & councillor.

Since he was discharged last week he’s back living with me again. His big sister, her partner and I are all desperately trying to help and support him! We all love him so much!

I’m trying to understand what he is going through. Please post any advice on what got you through this and any tips on what not to do in my situation as his father."

1225,I'm planning it.,w34bo6,six-herons,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w34bo6/im_planning_it/,3,SuicideWatch,False,"I know that there are people in this world who have it worse than me, but I'm tired of trying to force myself to be grateful when I'm just not. I guess in a way, that makes me feel like a bad person too.

My whole life has been a mess. Financial instability, divided family, moving over 20 times, bullying, abusive relationships. All I've got really is a roof over my head because of my scholarship, but I spend so much time working so hard to keep even that, and my inability to make time for anything else means that I don't really have hobbies, close friends, things to look forward to, which has made my depression creep in. Despite my hard work my grades are slipping heavily. I don't have much going for me.

I finally found the guy of my dreams. Things were looking up. I had something to hold onto, something that brings me joy. But my mental health took a toll on us. And he became verbally and emotionally abusive. Constantly starting yelling matches, throwing a tantrum if I lost keys, or worked late, or didn't spend 100% of my free time with him. I spilt water on his shirt one day and he made me wash his car.

One day I was invited to a party. I was really excited, thought I could finally make friends. I drank too much and started blacking out whilst dancing with a guy at the party. I started chugging water, trying to sober up, texting my boyfriend that I wanted to be with him. I tried ordering an uber but was too drunk to tell I had no data so my cab request wasn't being processed. I told the guy dancing with me that I was really drunk and wanted to sober up, he nodded and we kept ""dancing"" even though he was really just keeping me upright on the floor more than anything else. I could hardly stand and talk anymore. But he kept coming onto me and eventually made out with me. I guess I let it happen because I was drunk and hardly processing anything. I just went outside immediately and sat alone until a random stranger helped me get hold of my boyfriend. He was already annoyed that he had to drop me off, bring me my ID, and pick me up. When I told him I was harassed, he never forgave me. Never. In many ways he blames me.

It hurts because I get it, but I also feel victimized. I had never drunk that much, I had never been to a party like this. None of my friends helped me. Instead I became known as a sleeze immediately and now everyone at college thinks I'm a wh*re.

My boyfriend became more verbally abusive, then he forgave me, then he broke up with me again after admitting he never got over the incident. 

I feel so much guilt, regret, remorse. A week ago he took me to a fancy restaurant and told me he wants to marry me one day and move overseas with me next year.

He admitted a few days later that he has just been trying to convince himself that he wants this, despite knowing deep down that he doesn't. And he ended it.

It's not his responsibility to be my lifeline. But he was my only source of joy and security and love. When I looked into his eyes I felt something I had never felt before. And I don't want to live without him. And I don't want to live with the guilt.

I've always felt suicidal, but here I am, finally planning it now. The medication, the location, the note. I'm scared, but calmer than I thought I'd be. If there is a God I hope he forgives me."

I am giving myself one month to lose 15 lbs and if I don’t by then I am leaving. The only way I know I’ll be happier is if I lose weight. Right now, I struggle everyday to get out of bed, shower, get dressed, etc. because I feel absolutely hideous. At least if I lose weight I can do those basic everyday things and survive. I miss being able to feel my ribs without sucking in and pointy hip bones and feeling cold all the time. I miss buying XS clothes and them still fitting loose.
The beginning: I was abandoned by my parents when I was born. Something must’ve been wrong with me for them to do that. I immigrated to the US from China only to be stuck in the foster system for my first 4 years where I was traumatized emotionally and physically abused by my foster family (who were supposed to adopt me actually but “returned” me like a dog from a shelter). Growing up with social anxiety, BDD, and severe abandonment issues was just the cherry on top. I developed anorexia at the end of my sophomore year and somewhat recovered then the lockdown happened so my recovery all went to shit. My parents got divorced in the beginning of this year. I’m an only child and none of my extended family care about me. The only grandparent I did love and who loved me back passed freshman year and my favorite dog did too. I have good things going for me too though: I got accepted to my dream college and program and I am in a long-term relationship. I know those things are meaningless if I’m not motivated to put effort into them though. I know that the few who care for me will get over me eventually. And really, I’m just one person out of billions. I haven’t even contributed to society at 18. That’s not to say that people who don’t contribute are worthless, but my goal in life was to leave a positive impact on at least one person and that ain’t going to happen at this point. I’ve tried medication, therapy, and any other coping mechanisms and treatments. I just hope my boyfriend finds someone who treats him like the angel he is. I hope my friends live to grow old. Even if I lose the weight, I might still not want to live. I just want everyone I love to have the best life they can because I can’t."

But I’m honestly at the end of my rope. I don’t remember no worrying about something, I don’t remember not crying every day. I think this is my sign that this is finally it. I’ve tried and tried and the only thing I haven’t tried is a psych ward or medication. I think this is showing me that I can’t keep trying to find help when no one takes me seriously."
1231,Suicidal since I was 12,w36yue,dazai0506,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w36yue/suicidal_since_i_was_12/,2,SuicideWatch,False,I'm 18F and I have been suicidal since I was in the 7th grade that was the first time I seriously considered killing myself I tried to poison myself with parfume ik its stupid but after I drank the poison my head started spining while I was in bed and it honestly felt kinda nice. Around 14 I started to cut regularly and I only stopped around a year and half after I started to go deeper and deeper and use everything as an exuse to cut even use it to make my brother feel bad when he was being awful to me I stopped bc I made a very big cut and my dad started asking me about them which made me honestly shit myself since my dad is strict and if he found out he would not be nice about it at all. I have scars on my arm I used to put salt and other things to make the cuts hurt more since cutting litterly doesn't feel like anything. I have had non stop suicidal thoughts all my teen years and they are extremely stressful I genuinely believe that being suicidal Is who I am and find it weird that not everyone wants to die just bc of the way life is. I will not go and explain how I feel about life bc I think that might be bad for another suicidal person reading this but in short I hate everything I hate what I have to do everyday and what ik I will need to do in like I only like things that bring me pleasure bc who doesn't but I would give those up just to be dead. I need help bc I want to feel good about life it's really hard to be alive when all u wanna do is die.

I have epilepsy disease since I was born. I’m on many medications which they are no help in use but I’m using anyways. 

I committed suicide last month. I’ve taken so much pills. I remember that night so well. 

I was nothing at that time. There was no meaning. I’ve never felt so strong that I must commit to suicide. Emptiness was me at that moment there was no meaning, whether I live or die.  Before suicide I was living with my parents, now I left them. I no longer see them.

Before my suicide my boyfriend cheated on me and I know that. Now these days I want my revenge I want to cheat him I want him to break up from me I want to be left alone. If these happens I can have one night relations and when I feel I’m nothing I do not have meaning, I will kill myself

my life is so fucking miserable i dont even believe in God anymore. i feel like an orphan even though my parents and siblings live right here with me. i feel used all the damn time because no one cares about me or my feelings. i literally want to just kms and this time i might just go through with it

but yk i did try, i did 'stay hopeful' i did take care of myself, act fake and kept pretending 'nothing's wrong !! :)"" literally all throughout hs i was THE ultimate nerd, i got good grades, took college classes, tested out, did everything. i literally was a golden student. and i did this so i could go into the top uni and finally fucking LEAVE. and i DID get accepted and i was planning on going 100%. i planned on waiting until the last minute (august) to tell my dad i was finally moving until my fucking MOM told him late JANUARY that i got accepted (because early admissions), and he threw a fit and went crazy and i just knew there was no escaping from then on. so now im forced to take the city bus every single day to the community college in my city, no car no nothing, wasting money every single day, and then coming right back home.

a couple weeks ago in june i literally tried to go out with my friends for a small grad party, and he was idk eavsdropping on when i told my mom we were going to go get drinks from starbucks and he FUCKING SHOWED UP AT STARBUCKS. thankfully we didnt go to starbucks because my friend changed her mind, we went to another place instead. but he called my mom and was like ""shes not even at starbucks, they went somewhere else probably getting drunk and with boys, she's lying to you she's thinks she can fool me im taking her phone im putting a tracker on her shes so stupid blah blah blah"" like i felt so scared and from then on i just decided to cut off all my friends even though i didnt do anything wrong??? literally being punished for trying to have a good time. its middle of july and he's still bringing up ""how dare you go to a party and sleep with guys, i can't believe my family name is being dragged through the mud"" even though thats not fucking true and its been WEEKS. i can't stand it anymore i really cant.

and then on top of that he's literally forcing me to wrk a job that is so miserable and so draining and so depressing, the youngest person (before me) is like 30 so i will just be the odd one out. i literally accepted my fate until yesterday i was walking back home from the work orientation (no car haha 17 min walk in 90 degree weather!!) and i literally almost broke down because im going to have to do this every single fucking day of the remaining summer. i cant even motivate myself and be like ""well ur getting money !!"" every single dime i earn will be taken by him, so i doubt ill even be allowed to buy myself a car. 

 im so tired of keeping myself alive. no matter what i do theyre always fucking unhappy with me. im tired of being an adult i wish i could just have loving parents who love me and dont make lies about me and be a provider for me. i hate being the older sister that my younger siblings rely on i hate it i wish i wasnt the older sister. if i kill myself they will be hurt more but at least i wont have to keep on struggling. its selfish but ive been miserable for years and i cant keep doing this anymore. i literally cry every single day and i hate myself i hate everything i hate that im related to my father whenever i remember taht im related to him blood dna whatever i sob so much. i hate my father and ive become so fucking delusional because of him. i hate everything im either sad unhappy angry miserable 

  i dont even eat food i dont like to go outside i dont want to do anything anymore. i hate my life so much all i do is work. none of my friends even care to understand how miserable my life is they just get mad because ""ur never active"" i hate my life i have no bf/gf whatever i have no aspirations or no friend groups because i wasted all my high school years earning college credit that wont even fucking go through to the community college im enrolled in. ill just get associates and then what? become a fucking unhappy wageslave for the rest of my life, or be just stuck under my parents rule until im 20 something like my older sister.

Continuing to live feels like it goes against my moral principles.",w3amrt,Sogaple,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w3amrt/20_yo_ambitious_but_failing_in_every_regard/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I've felt this way for roughly the last 4 years. Not always this intensely, but it's been gradually getting worse and more bleak with the passage of time.

**TL:DR;** *I want to make the world a better place, but I'm a loser with no practical skills, intelligence or social connections. I struggle with empathy and focusing on tasks, and have multiple addictions which devour my time and energy. Worst of all, I'm a failure DESPITE the fact that I'm privileged and spoiled, with parents who have always provided for me exceptionally well. I've concluded that my mind is defective, and that to stop pointlessly wasting the world's energy and resources, I should die.*

It's a matter of conserving value - my existence consumes value and creates no value. I have lived a very sheltered life - never worked or done much socialising (outside of some gaming friends who I've completely lost touch with). My parents are financially stable and have provided for all my needs and whims - tutors, a private school, a generous allowance...

Despite this, I've never excelled at anything. I've dipped my toes into so many things; programming, writing fiction, writing analytical essays, philosophy, political debate, music, drawing, 3d modelling, long-distance running, psychology, linguistics, translation... I've failed in each one, never having the perseverance to bring any project to completion. I'm in university, but I still turn in all my assignments last minute, sometimes writing them the day they are due. Nothing has changed, it's like I'm still in high school. It's humiliating. I'm embarrassed to look my professors in the eye when I have such a shoddy work ethic.

All the while I'm thinking of all the people who have it 100 times worse than me. The humanitarian crises in the Middle East, in Africa, now in Ukraine. I should be doing something tangible to help, working, teaching, I don't know. At least I should educate myself on history, politics and economics to get a better understanding of these modern issues. But I can't. I feel so impotent. I try to read an academic paper or a textbook and my eyes glaze over as I struggle to finish more than two pages. I get caught up in pointless, repetitive tasks. I'm addicted to pornography, social media, alcohol and digital hoarding. All the while my parents are financing this comfortable, conformist lifestyle. I haven't taken any of the amazing opportunities granted by my privilege.

Over time, I've also grown more antisocial and bitter. I feel alienated from my friends and family - I try talking to them, but am immediately struck with the feeling that there's no point. ""Why are you talking? They can't help you. They don't care. If they cared, they would've asked you. But nobody starts conversations with you - you're always the one forcing yourself onto others. Do you really think your sister wants to listen to you complain about your life for the 100th time, when she has her own problems to deal with? And what do YOU get from this? Nothing. You have no clearer understanding of your problems, no plan how to solve them. Talking about yourself is just a way to feed your narcissism. Shut up and start working instead"".

But at the same time, it's almost like I cannot do things purely for myself. Whenever I create or think something, I absolutely MUST show it to someone or tell someone about it. It never feels like I do things ""for myself"", because to me, if I don't share it with someone, it's almost like it didn't happen. So I'm stuck in this violent cognitive dissonance where the instinctive part of my brain tells me ""This is so cool! Talk about it, show it to someone!"" but the cognitive, rational part of my brain tells me ""Don't talk. It's not 'cool', it's not 'interesting'. They don't care. You're wasting everybody's time. Just do it for yourself, for your own satisfaction. Why do you feel the need to share every event in your life? Just live it"".

Eventually, I realised that my mind is defective. Ever since I was a small child, I'd spend more time in my own daydreams and fantasies than interacting with reality, which is why I'm so socially maladjusted. These daydreams have gotten less severe, but I still have lengthy inner monologues and dialogues with an imaginary conversation partner / audience. I was diagnosed with ADD and started taking Ritalin quite recently, but it only improves my focus on specific activities. I still cannot organise my time and finances. And I KEEP FORGETTING TO TAKE MY MEDS, which doesn't help. As a result, every goal that I strive towards - less consumption, better education, better critical thinking, more complex and insightful art... I'm doing the exact opposite, making things worse. I'm spouting out my uneducated opinions, not doing proper research, creating artistic works which are unoriginal and derivative. I don't have enough real life experience to discuss anything with wisdom and insight.

I feel like killing myself is just the most logical thing to do. As someone who, after 20 years, has failed to make significant progress towards even one of my many goals, it's become clear my defective mind will always make me a parasite, kept alive by luck and support from my parents. My condition will only deteriorate, with death being only a matter of time - the question is ""kill yourself today"" or ""watch your mental and physical health slowly decline over the next 15 years, at which point you'll kill yourself anyway"".

I have a simple plan more or less set up. No suicide note (too much time to change your mind, and if you prepare it in advance, it quickly becomes outdated), a bottle of vodka to numb myself and lower my inhibitions (I fear dying and have a low pain tolerance) and a short walk at 4AM to an outdoors gym two blocks down to hang myself from the monkey-bars using my bedsheets. The only reason I haven't done it is because death is scary (I can't comprehend not existing, which terrifies me), ""what if I survive with crippling brain damage?"", and the occasional, rare spark of hope that I can somehow turn things around.

I wish I was never born. Sometimes I fantasize about how wonderful it would be if my consciousness could be annihilated, with some other mind taking over my body and using it for a better purpose."

I can’t stop thinking about suicide. My boyfriend died around two months ago in an accident. We were living together and I was the most happy person in the world with him. Before my relationship with him I was struggling with depression but he helped me so much that I wasn’t sad anymore thanks yo him. 

We got a lot of plans for our life together, travel, make a family, business together, kids, pets, plants, everything, and now he is gone and I’m alone once again. 

I don’t want to be with anyone else. I’m 29 years old and I’m very tired of people telling me that I’m to young and I will find love again. No, I want him, I am so deeply in love with him. 

All of my past relationships before him were toxic shit. I don’t want any of that again. 

My mother also died 4 year ago, I thought I wouldn’t experience a worse pain than that but I was wrong. Losing my soulmate is living in hell. I just want to sleep all the time, I’m not hungry, I don’t enjoy anything without him. 

I really thing that happiness is only real when shared, he used to have that phrase as a tattoo in his body. We were the same person, we understand each other so well. 

I’m very tired and I’m just looking ways of ending with my life. Everyday I hope something happens to me so I could stop this pain and be with him. 

I’m just very very very tired and my chest hurts very much, I really don’t want to live this way."

I had just recently moved in with my boyfriend and his siblings, and things seemed to be going well. We have been dating for almost 2 years now, and our relationship seemed to be going really great. He always seemed to be in high spirits despite some of the struggles we have been going thought (mostly financial). He had tried to kill himself about a year ago beforehand and ended up not going through with it, but even after that he had told me he was going to get better; and it seemed like he was getting better mentally. This morning however was really different. He was upset because he had woken up in a bad mood, and got mad at himself when our washer broke. I asked him what was wrong and if I could do anything for him, and his only response was to shrug his shoulders. He later went into the bathroom and I thought nothing of it. About 10 minutes later or so I hear screaming and crying coming from the bathroom. My heart sank and I rushed in there to find him sobbing on the floor next to the shower. He told me he had just tried to kill himself (using a shirt and the shower rod). It didn’t seem like he had done any damage (I checked his neck and his body and he didn’t have any injuries) but I honestly didn’t know how to handle this, and I’m not sure exactly what to do. I tried my best to stay with him until he calmed down, and I had helped him in calling the suicide hotline, but even so I feel like I haven’t done enough for him. Right now we are staying at my parent’s house and he is sleeping right next to me, but I’m so scared to do anything that involves leaving his side. Our roommates are going out of town this week, and my boyfriend works from home. I am scared to leave him alone to go back to work tomorrow, but I feel obligated to work due to our financial situation, and I just got promoted too so I’m trying to do my best to keep our financial situation in tact. I just want to know if there is anything I can do to let him know that I’m here for him? He is never willing to communicate his feelings to me despite me always asking how he’s feeling. I feel stuck, and I feel as if this situation has really been draining on my mental health. I just want to be there for him though. I feel like I could be doing more than I actually am.

All my life something has happened. 

When I was younger my cousin tried to suffocate me cause he thought I was annoying at 4 years old. When I was in grade school I was bullied all the time. I had a crush on a boy and he kicked my shins until they were black and blue. None of the adults around stopped him. Kids would pretend to be my friend to tell me their friend had a crush on me just to bring me over there and have everyone laugh at me. Also, when I was in my schools aftercare program, I’d be pushed to the point of crying then laughed at and put in time out by the counselors. I also went to a church camp and there was a kid I had a crush one who found out. He tried to drown me at a public pool and none of the adults around tried to stop him. 

In middle school a guy 2 years older than me would push punch and kick me around all his friends. This all happened in front of our band director and he did nothing, just chalked it up to boys being boys. He was so much bigger than me. I then went through my first death threat because I was just trying to do what I thought was helping this girl who was self harming. After that I started self harming. During this time, a guy in one of my classes was starting to touch me sexually and would punch me super hard if I moved. Then, someone told my school I was self harming and I was suspended because they searched my bag looking for things I used to hurt myself. I was stupid and brought the bag to school that I forgot had a razor blade in it. The school told my parents. My mom forced me to show everyone the cuts and I had to go to a Christian therapist.

High school was whatever, no one had a crush on me cause I was the emo band girl. But then college came around and I got in an abusive relationship for 2 years. After that I joined a sorority and went hard on the party life and was sexually assaulted more times than I’d like to admit. I tried to kill myself once but my friend was able to stop me. I moved away from my college town and the people at the job I got, local place, were nice but ended up threatening my life. It was cause I spoke out about a guy we all worked with. He sexually assaulted me and I, along with another girl, spoke out about what he did and those people were mad at me. They show up at my job now and then still a year later. There’s a little more but I think I’ve made my point that me living is just a waste. 😔"

Every day every week i keep failing. Just today i misplaced keys again and i cant bear facing my senior colleague. She did found it but i feel so useless.

1257,I hate this.,w39r5o,Manmaruji,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w39r5o/i_hate_this/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I live every day in a constant state of boredom. I cannot get enjoyment out of anything whatsoever. I have plenty to do, I just cannot do it. 
Every day feels the same. I try to leave my house occasionally. I’ll have good days every now and then. I played mortal kombat with some little kids at the arcade. It made me happy. But no matter what, I’m always discontent. Nothing will truly make me happy. This momentary happiness isn’t worth anything to me. I want true happiness. 
I’ve spent the past couple of years loving someone. No one has come close to being as good as them. No one will ever be like them. No one will ever treat me with as much love and care as they did. But now, they don’t give a shit about me. They ignore me, they never want to talk to me. I don’t understand what I did wrong. But they mean everything to me.
I am an empty shell of who I once was. I’m pathetic. I’m drowning in self hatred and pity. I spend my time day dreaming about how things could be. But they’re so unrealistic. They’ll never come true. And at night, I have vivid dreams of trauma and fears. I can’t escape.
I’ve grown to hate the feeling of being alive. I hate being conscious. I sleep too much because I hate being awake. I’ve decided I’m going to kill myself eventually. I don’t know when, but it’ll be soon. 

To those I’ve hurt, I’m sorry, and you’ll never have to see me again soon enough. I’m sorry for being such a god awful asshole. I’m sorry for being alive in the first place.

To those I love, I’m sorry for being such a burden. I’m sorry for being so clingy. I know none of you will ever love me. I’m sorry.

To those who love me… ah who am I kidding there’s no one who loves me.

Fuck everything. I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate this world."
1258,I'm almost 26 and I wasted my life.,w34rdq,aceshadow136,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w34rdq/im_almost_26_and_i_wasted_my_life/,3,SuicideWatch,False," I'll start with my job and economic situation since that's the part that gives me the most anguish. I hate my job, I work part time at UPS. The benefits are hardly ever worth it. It's mind numbing, tedious and difficult for little pay. It is difficult by the way since it involves a lot of heavy lifting, you're expected to do it extremely quickly, and there's a lot of chance for injury. I'm also 3K in debt for student loans and between bills and other expenses, I simply can't afford to pay it off. I tried finding other jobs but no one else will even give me a call back. I flunked college back when I was 19, and I have never been back since. I failed because I was lazy and because I was too focused on the social aspects. I felt I was too good for community college back then. I hate myself.

I had friends in High School and College but I've kept contact with none of them. Why should I? They would be more disappointed in me than I am in myself. They would rightfully pity me. I can't handle that. All of my classmates are probably more successful than me. I have no friends and my social anxiety is so severe that I can't talk to anyone. I hate myself. Another reason why I don’t have friends is because I am a toxic person. I don’t deserve friends. 

I can't save money because I have poor impulse control. Sometimes I manage to save money for a few months, but sometime later, I end up spending again on video games, alcohol or take out and I'm right back where I started. I don't even live on my own; I can't afford it. I basically rent out a room from my mother for roughly $200/a month. The fact that I STILL haven't moved out at this stage of my life makes me a loser. I had plenty of opportunities in my teen years but I pissed them all away. Just because I'd rather satisfy my impulses for the moment. I guess barely anything has changed. I don't have a car and even if I could drive, I couldn't afford one.

I tried to go back to writing and learn to draw but, I fear I don't have any time left. I'm transgender, Male to Female and a Lesbian. I'm also black. Contrary to what most people think, black people are extremely conservative. I read up on the statistics of the murder rate of people like me; even in a relatively ""Liberal"" city like Philadelphia, I'm not safe. By the way, I hate living in this city on most occasions. I can't come out and present as myself because I look too much like a man and I know that people would essentially kill me on the spot if I dared walk out as a woman. This is not helped by the fact that I have to work at night, another aspect of my job I hate. I can't afford ffs, so, I will always be seen as a man and I HATE being a man so much I HATE my face. I Hate how my job forces my body to be muscular. Some of this would be helped if my parents supported me but they don't. They deadname me, misgender me and barely hide the fact that they're disgusted by me. My siblings are supportive but, I still have to live with my parents so, I wish my sibling's support mattered more. Society clearly expects me to be a man for their comfort but, I just can't do that for them anymore.

This isn't helped by the anti trans hate being intensified not just in the mainstream but in the government. Republicans will get control of government again. When that happens, I'm finished. The Supreme court already struck down Roe v Wade If you think they will stop there, you're naive. In two to four years, my existence will effectively be outlawed. America is on the verge of fascism and nobody with any power will listen to me. I'm the exact type of person every American hates Black, Transgender, Lesbian, Autistic, Poor. Everybody hates me. Every American wants me dead when they vote for republicans in November, they would have proven that. The answer would be to fight but I'm not a strong enough person. I can't do it.

I can't even leave the country. Other governments still think that the US is still a stable democracy. When things inevitably go bad, it won't be perceived as bad enough to apply for refugee status. I don't have an advanced degree and I'm not rich. They will never let me leave. I'm stuck here to die.

Leaving the country won't help with the climate disaster that is coming. It's clearly happening and the people in charge won't do anything about it. Also, I didn't do enough to stop it. It's all over. Even the future seems like nothing but disaster and pain.

I'm planning to commit suicide tonight. I'll throw myself off some tall ledge. Most likely off the catwalk at work. Alternatively, I will step in front of a moving vehicle. I fully expect people to want me to do it. my very existence disgusts them. There's nowhere for me to run. I'm sick of everything and everybody. I'm sick of living in this country, I'm sick of everybody's scorn and hate, I'm sick of living for everyone else. I HATE LIVING. People keep saying that the United States is the best country in the world. It's not. If anything, it's the worst. Being a good person is useless. The evil people always win. The purpose of my life it seems and for anyone else like me is to suffer for everyone else's benefit. I can't take it anymore. It doesn't get better. Everything will only get worse. 

I know there’s people who have it worse, but I can’t handle my life getting worse. I can’t handle being homeless, I can’t handle being a man any longer, I can’t handle prison. I can’t handle getting killed by the state. I am a weak person and always have been. I don’t think there’s an afterlife waiting for me. If anyone who knows me reads this, I'm sorry I was such a disappointment."
1259,First time calling the hotline,w2nim7,youngwooki23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2nim7/first_time_calling_the_hotline/,24,SuicideWatch,False,"I called the suicide hotline for the first time ever, during a time i was seriously considering suicide. Before, i was pretty scared of doing that. I wasn’t sure of what I could possibly talk about and thought I might be wasting their time. I thought that my problem wasn’t nearly as important as other people’s. I thought they would think I was weird if I opened up. 
But the guy that answered the call was really nice. He seemed a little amateur, and had some long awkward silences (maybe cause I was also really awkward opening up). But I could tell that he was trying super hard to be supportive. He tried to get me to open up more and talk about my problems even more which was uncomfortable at first, but really helped in getting things off my chest. He genuinely made me feel at least a little better and was understanding and kind about everything. Im glad i was able to talk to him, and glad i was able to overcome my fear of calling the hotline."

That chair can go fuck itself. That drywall too. I'm done just staring at it. I've decided to pick myself up and actually do something. Committing suicide won't magically fix my problems. Nor will staring blankly at drywall. I have to actually try.

&#x200B;

Bad news is, if I get thrown down by life once more, I won't feel like getting back up. Something I believe in is if it doesn't work once, don't try it again as it won't work if you try again. That leads to the definition of insanity.   


Anyway, to the main point of this post. I've tried to talk to my friends online as I have no one in real life to talk with. I understand if they're busy and they can't respond. They have a life that they need to live and the world doesn't revolve around me, so I don't expect an immediate response. I make sure to only text the friends I see who are on and not too busy as I don't wanna interrupt anyone's game or plans. Problem is, I've known these people for over a year and I'm still only getting basic one word or sentence responses. Any time I bring it up, they just stop talking to me for the rest of the day. Some just leave or brb without even telling me before they go. I'm starting to question if they're my actual friends or not. I'm leaning towards no. Now with no one wanting to love me, no one even wants to be my friend or stay my friend."

most of my friends don't even know i am depressed and ill like this usually i'm the one in the group who jokes around, makes everyone laugh, etc but the people who do have a hint of whats going on cannot know anymore i will not allow myself to be so toxic any longer it is getting harder to keep up the facade of being completely okay and untouchable and it is hard to help my friends who are also struggling when i am in the gutter myself. i have no use to anyone any longer.

my family doesn't know i'm like this either and when i think i do slip up they havent seen the signs for 11 fucking years

I was delivering food recently for Doordash and felt like a robot appliance operating in the architecture of sin. People ordering unhealthy fast food like Burger King, Popeye's, Wendy's. Probably too tired themselves to make a healthy meal.

People reject me and ignore me. There's no love in my life. At all. I have 1 friend I talk to in a different city, who's probably used by the reality to keep me hanging on a thread, otherwise I would've ended it by now. 

I feel like if I stopped eating and drinking I could exit the body fairly easily. I'm already abhorrently skinny. 

It wouldn't be suicide, it would be refusing to participate in this loveless hell loop. Death would come as a secondary effect of my primary decision to stop consuming shit just so I can hang around in a realm that clearly doesn't want me. 

I live in a tiny studio, I have no partner, no real job, my family kicked me out, no friends. Every attempt I make to form relationships fail. 

I basically don't exist. All that would die would be this body. I go to sleep alone, wake up alone, eat alone, sit on the floor alone, work alone... 

I don't know how many times I have to make these threads, tell people I feel like a trapped animal, work on myself with no improvement, try to make relationships with no reciprocity, etc. Life itself has absolutely no interest in my continuity. The body does. The body."

Hey! Im new here, in every sense of the word, and I don’t really know what to say? I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety and moderate depression, but I’ve been really good about covering it up and people who know me will say I’m one of the bubbliest people they know and that I’m the type to make friends with anyone.

And it is true I guess, that I have a really friendly personality when I box away the more negative emotions. But now this next year, I have to stay at home and do online school and I have nothing to distract me and the thoughts are louder than ever and the other night I was coming to bed when I saw a bottle of Tylenol on my floor and just had a fleeting thought about what it would be like if I took too many. Kinda caught myself and was just like what the fuck.

Not to mention, I got drunk a few weeks ago and wrote a kinda? suicide note. It’s titled “for when i’m gone” which is exactly as dramatic as I’d expect drunk me to say. Im not actively planning anything and I’m still happy enough with my life but thoughts will just creep into my head about maybe, what if?

If anyone has any advice about where to go from here, because Im kinda in a confused state of mind about it. Im not planning on acting on these thoughts but they’re some sort of morbid daydream. Also, not sure if this is allowed but Im posting the “note” that I wrote below. Have a read if you get this far, lol.

I lived in uni dorms and I got along well with my flat mates but as much as we were amicable they weren't friends but they seemed to instantly connect to each other.

I'm currently in a job I'm ambivalent about. I've had worse, I worked in a call centre which really made me feel depressed. Doing the same thing day in day out same conversations structured with little wiggle room. I met a girl there and she told me about TEFL. I was enthusiastic again - anything to get me out my rut. I got my certificate and left. Then covid happened. No covid was an excuse.

I'd already started to become disenchanted with life abroad. No real reason everyone was lovely, I even had a bigger social circle who I saw more often than I did my own friends back home. Yet I couldn't help but feel like the one who was a tag along, the extra man. I used Covid as an excuse and come back home. When there was a rash of suicides in my area, I loudly expressed my disapproval of how the individuals got to the point of considering it as a valid option. Anything so my family doesn't suspect - that if an accident does occur, why I didn't fight to survive. I hoped covid would take me.

Now I'm in a job I don't love but don't hate. I was going to get back into uni and even took the begining steps to make it happen, but I've lost enthusiasm again.

I'm tired. I still just want to sleep. I recently had a smear test and now I'm hoping for something to come back to give me an out. If I could do something that wouldn't make my family suspicious, I would. I don't want them to live with the torment of ""What if's"".

Yet it's getting harder to keep that conviction. I'm somewhere on the asexual scale so I know I'm not going to have a partner or children. I won't have my own family unit and truthfully can't say I want it. As an adult I'm not given the same amount of focus instead we're welcoming my niece, god sons, cousins etc. And I'm so happy for them. And due to this I think that they would grieve but come out stronger, focus on the new generation - bond together.

My parents would struggle the most so I've been giving them keep sakes to remember me by - ironically most are placed together so it looks like a shrine anyway. I think it would bring them comfort. I started making jokes about being a narcissist so they don't suspect.

I can't tell my family I'm struggling because they would blame themselves. There's nothing to blame. They're not perfect, but they're mine and I never doubted that they care. There's no trauma. No dark secret. No traumatising past. I feel like If I tell anyone It would just be a cry for attention. But I don't want attention. I'm just done. I honestly and truly don't know why I should struggle in a world that I hold apathy for when I'm just going with the flow and any enthusiasm for future projects quickly dwindles."
1277,please help. this is going to be long and im sorry but i dont know what to do anymore.,w383d8,Personal_Boot_9623,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w383d8/please_help_this_is_going_to_be_long_and_im_sorry/,1,SuicideWatch,False," 

throwaway for obvious reasons. I am not a danger to myself at the moment, but I am considering self harm as a way to externalize some of the internal pain I feel.

I've been in the mental health system for going on 6 years. I have tried the following therapies: CBT, DBT, EMDR, humanistic, psychoanalytic, etc. I have tried various different medications/combinations of SSRIs, stimulants, etc. I have at some point in my life, been suspected of or diagnosed with the following: GAD, depression, OCD, ADHD. Nothing truly helps. For as long as I can remember, ever since I've been alive, I've felt a bit ""weird."" There's just this strange feeling when I analyze my past and look at myself. I'm in my 20's, still in school, but up until this point I've mostly been able to function. In fact, I am a dean's list student at my school, so people sometimes invalidate my struggles because I am so ""intelligent."" School hasn't been too hard. It's been showing up to class, and getting my work done at home. Working in a home environment, and having the general commitment of three classes a day is something I can handle. Currently, I work a summer job, and its quite debilitating. I sleep 8 hours every night but I am so tired I want to cry. I should mention I am seeing a medical doctor, psychiatrist, and therapist for these issues, and have a full round of bloodwork that came back mostly normal, minus a couple minor deficiencies. The idea of ""work"" kills me, even if I am good at school. I really struggle with understanding the world around me. When people give me a responsibility, my brain freaks out. I feel mental anguish (I would say anxiety, but its more than that) driving, going to work, being at work, talking to friends even. I have anywhere from 50-200 independent suicidal thoughts a day, but its almost as if I LIKE it. Those thoughts give me a sense of relief and freedom. I don't think I would ever do it, but I constantly think about it. I have all kinds of weird issues surrounding clothing, bowel movements (not even joking. its more on the sensory side of things than like an IBS type issue, if that makes sense), and just general mental processes. I wish I was traditionally depressed so I could lay around all day, but my mind still craves stimulation, hopeless as I am. I have to have activities to occupy myself, which is a blessing and a curse. I find some solace in video games and reading, but even those are sometimes ruined for me. I have a neuropysch evaluation but it is not for a while. They are pretty booked. I suspect I have autism of some sort but I'm really not sure. Sometimes I think nothing is even wrong with me, I'm just this way. Which is even scarier. To be honest, if there's no explainable diagnosis or support for this I may end up offing myself. Its debilitating. I have a pretty supportive, normal family. I come from an upper middle class background. I dont understand why I am this way. And no I'm not having a ""crisis,"" in the traditional sense. I have these feelings every week. I try to start off the week on a positive note, but usually by tuesday morning I want to end it. Its been this way for years, even with all kinds of treatment. I just want to be able to be a functioning, normal, relatively stable adult. but i dont know if i will be able to when the time comes. my parents support me through school, but I don't know what I'll do when I have to be on my own two feet. home is my safe place. if I could sit in my room all day, things might be easier. but I cant. I have to function. I have to talk to people. I have to work. i have to exist and I cant take it. I have tried to believe I am worthy of good things and a happy life. I havce tried to reframe my thinking. no matter what I do, I dont BELIEVE it. truly, I hate myself. every waking moment is pain. sometimes more, sometimes less. the things I hyperfixate on and enjoy, those cost money. I have to work to live in this world but it brings me pain. i dont know what is wrong with me anymore. and i dont know what to do about it. there is so much more i need to say but ive already went on too long. ive tried so much. i wont kill myself, but i wish every single day that i hadnt been born. im tired of suffering just to die in the end anyways. what is wrong with me"

In and out of rehab for a decade. Bpd. Possible ADHD. Litany of failed relationships and embarrassing work and family situations. 10k+ in debt. Living with my mom after my relationship went south end of last year and I had to leave my dream job cos I started using again. Just don't seem to have it in me to get clean this time. Doctors not helping. Waiting for mental health services taking too long. Bought loads of equipment to end my life in the most effective way possible and was interrupted in march of this year and had to leave it all as I was thrown out of my flat (it came with the job). I really don't see how I've got anything else left to live for really. Im a burden to my family. and I have no friends or romantic interests. I don't know anyone except my mum in the part of the world I moved to. I really think my mum would be the only one that would miss me. And at the moment I don't feel like that's enough. Being suicidal Is like tunnel vision for me. It becomes an obsession to the point where thinking about ending my life is the only thing that stops me from feeling pain. And that is how I feel at the moment. I also started driving to a very famous suicide spot in the south of England two months ago. I never knew the bottom was this far down. Please help me please

I reached out for psychiatric help after so many mental breakdowns. I had a disturbed childhood. I was raped at the age of 5. The sexual abuse kept going on until I was 11 years old. my parents kept denying such things happening to me until recently I saw a psychologist. Which led to the open the Pandora’s box for me. What I once thought was a nightmare due to trauma from the events for 16 years was actually what happened to me in reality.

My parents accused me for what happened to me at the age of 5 and onwards. 


They think my mental health is a joke and refuse to buy me my medication. They keep abusing me mentally. They are emotionally manipulative. 

Today was the last straw. My dad and I got into an argument over 30 dollars which led to him beating the shit out of me. After threatening him by calling the police, my mother and father both ganged up on me by verbally abusing me. I couldn’t take their abuse anymore and stood up which made them kick me out of the house. 

I’ve done everything to help my household financially. I’ve tried to keep my cool every since their abuse started but now I can’t I take it anymore and I’m thinking of my ending my life because they’re no purpose left for me with parents who kill your motivation and will to live.

My friend has struggled with depression for a very long time but now I’m afraid for/of her. Let’s call her Taylor for the purpose of this post. Taylor usually texts me when she feels like she wants to end it, and I usually talk her off that ledge. She’s seen multiple professional and has undergone 72 hour surveillance for her mental health issues before, but she seems to always come out worse for wear.Like Taylor spirals immediately after  leaving professional care.

Lately, Taylor has been telling me how she doesn’t feel connected to anyone or feel empathy for anyone. I’ve tried to get Taylor to get help but she refuses. She completely cut off the person who got her sent for the 72psych hold and I’m afraid if I put in a tip about Taylor to a hotline, she’ll fake her way through the evaluation again and then won’t have anyone to talk her off the edge. 

On a text conversation, I told Taylor I was getting ready to go to bed and she spiraled and begged me to let her kill herself guilt free. So I stayed on the phone for hours and nothing happened. But it’s always a cycle where she messages me late at night to say she’s done with life and then I talk her out of it and then she’s fine. Taylor never shows this side to anyone else because of the girl who “ratted” (her words) and got her placed in to surveillance. Taylor also tells me how terrible everyone else in her life is to her but I’m not sure if that’s true or if she says that to keep me from telling them that she’s struggling.

Then, the other night, she propositioned me for sex out of nowhere. I’m so exhausted; I don’t know how to decline without setting her off. And I don’t want my family to suffer any consequences if something happens. 

I feel like if I put in a tip about her she’ll cut me off and then won’t have any support system left, but this I has been going on for years and I think it’s getting to me."

I was always depressed, I was always running away from everything. From my problems, from my responsibilities and from anything that I truly wanted. If I wanted and could fail or not have it, I would just run away. Now, I'm 29, actually even in a good financial situation, but I just feel I lost so much time, you know? That now I'm a boring as fuck adult, because I just haven't really lived anything.

I always feel that I'm the stupidiest, most desinteresting person in any room I'm in. I feel that I haven't got anything to offer to the handful of people that actually cared for me in the end. I'm so exausted of being myself, of my body, of my face, that I just want to end this. I have a mother and 2 sibling that I now will be in pain if I go. But every day that passes I fell that I'm just surviving, no matter what i'm doing. And every day that passes I just feel older and older, and nothing that I can do will change or stop this.

Growing up I never had a group of friends. I was always stuck in home with my crazy parents living each day wanting it to be the last. In my adolescence I just could't bond with anyone with just how little and worthless and broken I felt all the time. When I made 21 I tried to kill myself 2 times, one by drowning and the other one by throwing myself off a high place. The later one I couldn't do afraid to just break my legs and also had that to deal with. When I was 23 I tried it again, this time cutting my wrists, but couldn't cut them deep enough to actually hit where I wanted. In the end, just got some fucking terrible scars and my left hand lost some mobility for a time.

Before COVID and being able to work from home, I was fired from all of my jobs because I just couldn't take the responsability for them. I would get in late, miss things that were demanded for me to do, slack, etc. Right now, I still do these stupid, stupid things but without someone watching I can mask it better. No matter how much I rationalize that they're bad, how much they fuck my life, I just keep doing them.

I've entered 4 universities (in my country they're free if you pass some exams) and never passed 1 full semester. And never lived the life that being around so much people brings you. I would just go by the motions, and skip all the assignments that I had, sometimes for not preparing myself, sometimes, just from being so fucking scared to fail. And now, I'm just too late to want to live any of that.

And well, about my appearance? I fucking disgust myself every time that I see me in a mirror. This is unbearable, you know? I just can't keep living when every last think about me just feels wrong. When I just feel so fucking empty of live and remembrances. I have even written my last letter to some of the most important pearsons for me. But the remote chance that I can fail this atempt too just gets me angry. I want to go kill myself knowing it will work, not that i'll be in a bed for the next 30 years and be even more of a hindrance to the world that I already am."

My current partner doesnt love me for who i am, and the person that used to give me hope and loved me for myself, left me for good. I didnt cherish that person and i was going thru lots of drug and alcohol problems.

 Trying to quit didnt bring anyone back.

I want to die because i feel like my life is just going to end in my dying alone or just living an unfulfilled life.
Im trans ftm and my boyfriend isnt gay. Ive been to therapy for 3 years. Nothing works. I just feel more and more horrible.

I trusted my boyfriend to hug me when i needed it but it never happens. He once just sat there on his phone while i cried and begged for his love because i just really needed it, as my mental health was deteriorating at the time.
Recently he told me ""you wont do it"" when i said i was feeling suicidal.
It only pushed me to feel worse and sit near a pool for an hour(i cant swim), on the phone with the hotline.

I used to be stronger than this, but i guess having schizoaffective disorder is just something that makes me unlovable. I dont know how to move on from losing who i thought was my soulmate, that i dated for 15 years. I failed her and i fail everyone all the time.
I cant work as im not group friendly. Cant follow orders well, i think. 

I dont want instructions on how to die, obviously. But i dont know where else to go. Everything is either my fault or whatever and im really losing my mind.

I dont even have a place to cry. Everyone will either get mad or ignore me. Sometimes just watch me cry.

I want help but i also want to just be brave and end it all. Because that's the only way they'll understand. I've been sad all my life. I just want it to stop. I tried not to post here cause i feel like im just seeking attention but i feel so alone. Sorry"

So a week ago my now ex-girlfriend, with whom I've been together for 2 1/2 years, broke up with me.
During this period I have been struggling with personal problems, which I couldn't work out due to my issue opening up to anyone. With those problems still present, I had difficulties getting motivated and I was constantly mentally as well as physically tired.
You could say, that I never ""learned"" to talk to anyone about my issues.
I did try therapy during these years but without success. I just didn't feel comfortable talking to them.
With unsolved issues on my back and this massive breakup adding to it, my life is so bad, I did even considered suicide once or twice. 
There has been this friend 3 years back, who was there if I needed anything. 
But as this relationship advanced, the friendship faded.
The thing is if I do not talk to anybody whom I'm comfortable with, I'm scared I will hurt myself.
I don't really have any friends,  I'm also uncomfortable talking to my parents about it.

I’ve been thinking for a long time about posting any of this and now I decided to just do it.

All I want is to tell my story to someone and maybe even get my story read. The story I never told anybody about. The story that would maybe make people understand why I am the way I am. I wrote down my past on my profile. It’s very long. Please don’t feel obligated to read it all.

I've been a liar, almost always put up a facade, and apathetic to others. Sometimes my heart rate jumps and I panic without any reason. I manage to hide it from others by telling them that I was just feeling a bit sick.

I have been contemplating suicide for about 5 years now. All that my life is now is a rollercoaster of suddenly feeling very happy or very sad about life. Constantly enjoying things as they are and then thinking about putting a bullet through my head or jumping off a building. 

I also thought about killing myself on the construction site I worked on and trying to let it look like an accident, but I wanted to die for sure and didn't want to take the risk of surviving and then needing to tell everything to my mother. I never told her about how important she is to me and that she is almost the sole reason that I'm still alive.

I hold back because my mother would get all the blame from my family. I always thought about how this would hurt her and my brother. I don’t want to give my family that satisfaction.

I always need to put up a facade, even when I meet somebody new. I'm shy and my ego shatters easier than glass. I want to open up to others but can't because I fear getting hurt. I overthink the meaning of everything. I'm scared that others view me as weird. The only thing I’m good at is putting up a facade to hide behind it. I don't want to continue anymore, but still, I'm afraid of death.

Everyone needs to die, so why not cut to the chase? Just because you may only live once?

Life doesn't make sense. Nothing is important and everything is pointless.

I don’t know what I'm doing anymore."

It’ll be me saying something to join in or joke with my family that may be a bit inappropriate, e.g ill take a crap and joke about how big it was my dad would in response start yelling, talk about how shit i do in school, comment on my weight (I’m underweight but i store fat mostly in my stomach so it appears i have a-lot of fat all together) and tell me to fuck off back upstairs because of how disappointed he is in me. Honestly i don’t even make those sort of jokes anymore but when I’m around any of my parents but mostly him they’ll make me regret coming to see them. Today i seriously could not take it though, i was sat with my brother playing a game while my dad was making some food with me, i didn’t really know how to play the game so my brother was explaining before my dad came over, interjected and aggressively started explaining instead. While he was pointing at a piece in the game he was digging into my finger so i moved his finger away. This resulted in him yelling saying “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” And saying forget it and walking away saying something like “Stay a stupid piece of shit then.” After getting back to making food he started berating me and said these things “What did i do to deserve such a fuck up of a faggot son?” (Im not gay but i told my dad a few years ago that i wasn’t attracted to anyone including women) “this is why me and your mother neither love or want you.”, “i do so much and you do nothing. You go on about wanting me not to call or say certain things towards you.” Promptly after saying this he slammed the plate of food on the table and said “Joke on it.” Before returning to the living room. I know this isn’t that bad compared to other things but it happens almost everyday and i cant take it anymore. I don’t care if I’m ‘soft’ or ‘weak’ i cant take it anymore and i genuinely just want to die now. I have no one to speak to. My “friends” don’t like me and talk down on me and my brother and mother (even though they’re divorced) will defend my father. 

By the way i told my mother about it and she said that it’s understandable what he said as i should realised how that can annoy someone and that i should’ve asked him to move it instead."

Returning from lunch to work (not my current one). I always had to take a crosswalk to go into the office building. Huge traffic, as always.

Then I thought ""This is my opportunity."" And for a second, I didn't stop walking. Of course my stupid instinct of survival kicked in and made me stop. The driver would never have braked because he didn't noticed me at all.

I regret it everyday. Every single day of my life I relive this in my head. This perfect opportunity life gave me and I blew it. A 100% effective suicide that would look like an accident.

Today I barely survive. I have a severe depression. Therapy failed. Medication didn't work. My despair and hopelessness are so big I just want to cry. I could have left this world with still some good memories. Now everything is gone.

If life granted me a wish, any wish I could ask, I would return to that day in 2019 to kill myself."

They called me a psycho, a sociopath and many other stuff just because i asked a girl out. They wanted to protect her from me, since i was violent in their eyes. Truth is i never hurt someone, i cant do that. Not with words nor with hands. But that's what i got for liking and doing martial arts. University took away my energies with constant failures, first cause teachers decided to make me and others fail, then because i lost any interest in studying. I got close to getting a good job but nothing, they gave It to someone else. Aside from these i don't blame anyone for what is going on in my mind right now. My family, my friends, my online girlfriend, all the people i know.. they're good people, they deserved better than me.
Not a fucked up idiot who took all the wrong decision.
A better son, cousin, friend, boyfriend. Not me.

I tried everything, but i was the problem. Therapy, religions, new friends, new university. Everything i can try i did.

Last hit was my cat death. It destroyed any left spark of life i had. 

I didn't think i could suffer like that from a death, since my uncle, a close one, death didnt hurt at all. I felt so cold and i realised something with me was off. I started therapy, only to come to the conclusion that i didnt live those years, i just made my body go on and not rot.

Two years ago, months before covid, i hurt my leg badly and today i still have limits on how much i can move without feeling pain.

I'm a mess, the only thing i can think of is ending this. I know how to, i just need a few hours alone. 

I'm worried only about a person, my online girlfriend. I can only hope she will hate me for the rest of her life after i die. 

I just need to write a letter and a few hours alone.

I hope i'll suffer when I'll swallow all those medicines. I want to feel the worst pain ever, just to remind my body was still alive, while all the rest is already dead.

I've been a happy and playful kid all my life. I was  a talkative and a very curious child.

When I was around 7 or 8 years old my parents noticed that I have started stammering/stuttering, they just told me that I should stop doing this and speak normally or not speak at all. Years passed by and my stuttering increased gradually and I started avoiding conversations with strangers, but still I was pretty confident while talking to my close friends. Once I got to read out news in front of the whole school in 8th class...It was a disaster and everybody laughed at me. I've never been to a stage after that incident. Being a stutterer the anxiety and stress of getting embarrassed and shamed is with me all the time. When I have to say a word to someone, when my parents hand me phone to talk to a relative, when I go to market to buy something...the anxiety and stress is at par and 90% of the time I stutter. This brief summary of my past life actually adds up to the stress and depression I'm always in. To deal with the stress I played games and listened to music all day. I was a bright student earlier, but as years passed by my grades went down.

My friends are not supportive of me, or I must say that I wasn't able to make good friends who can understand me. I made a girlfriend last year, and she was the most supportive and caring person I've got apart from my family. But a few weeks ago we broke up due to some issues we had. I lost the only person who I loved and adored more that anyone.

I'm want to pursue B.Tech from Computer Science and for that I need to get into a government college. My father has spent around 2.5 lakhs in a coaching institution, but I know my condition and I won't be able to make it to a good government college. I'm from a middleclass family and my father cannot afford a private college. My JEE Session 1 (Entrance test for engineering colleges) score was very bad, I wasn't able to face the disappointment my father had. I am disgusted at myself that I can't even give my father back after what he did for me these 18 years. I've lost all hopes in myself. I can't look at my father's disappointed face.

I don't even know if I can fix my speech defect and face the world. I've accepted that I'm a loser. People would be more happy If I were not around.

I do want it to be known that I'm not an immediate danger to myself, if at all. I'm too much of a coward to really ever do anything.

I've been suicidal quite a few times in the past 5 years. After the death of my father it shocked me awake to the reality that is death and loss, and I thought I was good from then on out. But the ideation came back. It's always in the back of my head, waiting for the perfect time. 

This time, my problem that's causing these thoughts, is that I just can't adult well. I know it's not common for young adults my age (23) to feel like they have their shit together, but I'm just going nowhere even though I feel like I'm trying hard to get out of my situation.

I live with my mother and my sister, the house was paid off after my father passed and my mother doesn't charge us rent. She doesn't really charge us any sort of bill. I'm extremely grateful for this but she does bring up sometimes about how she pays my car insurance. I have told her several times that if she tells me how much I owe her/gives me the information I'll pay her. Or pay it myself. I don't even know how to go about doing that.

I pay for groceries/toiletries for the house, my own food, clothing, gas, basic needs. I feel guilty that I feel stuck and broke even though I don't pay rent or utilities. Like I need to be doing better to save and move out already. Things are very expensive and I make $15/hr but work has cut my hours dramatically lately. 

That brings me to work. I hate my job. I work retail, that's all I have experience in. No matter what retail job I'm at, it is absolutely miserable and at some point I'm sick of it and I feel stuck and exploited and that's when I start feeling suicidal. I've been at my current job for around 9 months. It was alright, I enjoyed my coworkers and the customers weren't so bad when I started. We were decently staffed. Then a change in management happened. Corporate cut our hours, the new manager only gave hours to the people he liked, a bunch of people quit. Barely any new employees were hired. Cut to me having to do 4-5 jobs at once by myself for most of my shift, and when I do get backup it's one person. I rarely get to take my breaks anymore. Customers can be absolutely cruel and relentless and management rarely backs us up anymore. If they even come up to help at all. I dont get any recognition unless i sell the damn credit cards which is extremely hard because no one fucking wants one. If i dont start making the numbers they want from me in terms of credit cards, ill get written up until i eventually get fired. I feel exhausted. Mentally, physically, spiritually.

I know if I changed jobs I would feel a lot better. I'd still be living with my mother but it'd be better. I just don't know where to go from here. My mother wants me to continue college and get a degree in psychology, then become a therapist. I don't hate this idea, I think I'd be a decent therapist and I enjoy the subject. It's very hard to juggle both school and work for me, and school is just another expense. I also started at a community college during the pandemic online, with my dad having passed only about a month prior and my mother a mess, I had no one to help me figure it out. I suppose I should have called and talked to an advisor but I have yet to do that. This led me to take some classes I didn't actually need for my degree, and realize there's still a whole bunch of classes I need for even my associates in psychology. I've only been doing 1-3 classes at a time since I work as well and it depends on what I can afford. 

I'm making no progress in either school or my job. I don't know what I want from my life. 

I'm trans female to male, and queer. I live in the deep south and it's horrible. They're basically trying to outlaw being queer here. They've already taken away the rights I had for my reproductive system. I'm scared what's come next. I haven't been able to start my medical transition yet, it's just something I've been meaning to get around to. I have to see an endo because I'm pretty sure I have weird hormones already, and I have to see if they'll even prescribe me testosterone. If I can afford the surgery that'll make me feel at home in my body, it my insurance will cover any of it. If I can even get a doctor who will sterilize me, let alone do gender affirming surgery. It's all a gamble. And if I do start my medical transition, I'll be met with a lot more discrimination than I already face because I'm 5'1"" and petite in every way. I highly doubt I'll pass. And I can't just go back to living as a girl. It's absolutely miserable pretending.

My health anxiety is ruining my life and making me fear death every day (ironically this also makes me feel suicidal. Scared of dying = wanting to die. Make it make sense.) I haven't been able to make much progress on my anxiety because it's mostly trauma based from losing my dad so suddenly. He had a heart attack (his first) and passed away at 56. No warning, no signs, nothing. He was fine and then an hour later he was gone. 

I like to think I've dealt with the grief as best as I could. He died at the very beginning of the pandemic so it was very hard to get any sort of support. I actually had to be the support for my family for around the first year or so, because I was the one who was doing the best, I guess. I've dealt with pain and sadness so I was able to meet grief head on and deal with it healthily. I miss my dad more than anything, but I've made peace with it. At least I think.

I'm terrified of dying, or of any other family members passing. I've stressed myself out worrying about my mother who refuses to wear a mask or get vaccinated, even though I've told her in tears how lost I would be without her. How we needed her to take care of herself because we can't lose our other parent. She's been antivaxx since we were babies and hasn't changed her mind. The covid vaccine was actually my first vaccine, and I've been working on getting caught up since then.

My mother has been spending 80% of her time in a neighboring state with her boyfriend. They've been together around 8 months I wanna say. He's alright. He loves her and she loves him and I'm happy that she's happy. But she spends more time with him and his family than us. I get it, me and my sister are adults. His children are still young. She's planning on moving in with him sometime soon but we don't know when. Me and my sister have been struggling to keep up with taking care of the house, pets, and our own work and schooling just the two of us. And when my mother does come home she finds things to be upset about in the house that we haven't done. Even though she's gone all the time. 

She recently told me she wants to have a talk with me about my future. This is stressing me out because lol what future? Where am I going? What do I even want to do with my life? When am I going to move out? How can I save up money better? Am I even able to live on my own and be a functioning member of society? Will I be happy?

Is this planet even going to have a future? This country? Is it even worth it worrying about my own small issues when I don't even know what's going to happen in general in the next couple years?

There's just a lot on my mind lately. I don't have much hope for things changing. I know I should probably go up on my dose of zoloft, that'll make me feel better. But it won't take away my issues. 

If you made it to the end, thank you. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that even though my life is cushy I'm sitting here complaining about it and wanting to end it. I'm just depressed and tired. I'm sure I'll be fine at some point soon."
1364,I’m constantly fantasizing about the most painless way to die.,w2z9hz,coffeeglo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2z9hz/im_constantly_fantasizing_about_the_most_painless/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"
First of all, please don’t tell me to go to therapy- I’ve been in and out of therapy for the past 17 years, and medication only made me worse (I self harmed on meds.) I feel like I’m constantly being gaslit by people telling me to go to therapy. When I explain that I was literally in therapy sense before puberty, people tell me I just haven’t found the right one. To be honest, some of not most of the therapists I’ve seen have done more harm than good and I feel like I’m stuck with the damage. And I have no one to go to. I’m constantly being judged and pressured by everyone around me.

I faced ENORMOUS pressure as a kid to get that degree and be successful. Well I did and now I’m stuck with insane student debt and making very little. I’m in a constant cycle of work hard to tackle this debt/become burned out/get back into it. I have so many out of touch family members that are pressuring me to have kids (I’m married) and are scratching their heads as to why I can’t buy a house. Inflation is through the roof and any extra income is just eaten up. I can’t afford simple joys in life. Meanwhile they have vacation homes and fully funded retirement plans, (or retired in their 60s) could afford for the mother to stay at home, paid off homes. My grandparents still have health insurance from the jobs they retired from.

Honestly I’m just beyond burned out at this point. I didn’t ask to be born. I feel violated that I had to be born just to become a slave until I die. And I have to put on a happy face at work and for others. If I don’t, I’ll get fired. I can’t deal with the pressures of being an adult woman in today’s society. I’m expected to work full time, save for retirement, have a house, have kids, a happy marriage, be fit and pretty, and well educated. Any time I accomplish something people ask what’s “next.” I’m never enough as I am.

I never imagined what pressures would come upon me after marriage. My husband is wonderful and really does his best. But I just can’t keep up. I’m expected to do all of the above for society and somehow still want to have sex with my husband and be pleasant. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror because stress is making me ugly… I can’t eat healthy, I’m breaking out, I can’t sleep at all. I haven’t slept properly in a month… I lay down and can’t fall asleep, and I wake up in the middle of the night just with pure dread. I’m sitting here and it’s 2pm on my day off and I can’t even take a shower. I can’t take care of myself and the house is an insane mess.

My dream is to get my hands on something that will just put me to sleep and take it with some alcohol. Tbh I have a gun but I’m not going to shoot myself… this sounds stupid, but when I bought a gun, I made a promise that I would never kill myself if life got me down. So please don’t worry about that, I’m a woman of my word. That’s why I want to poison myself. I need to find a way just so I can escape."

1369,Reasons to live from a survivor,w2p323,Artistic_Dust1670,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2p323/reasons_to_live_from_a_survivor/,4,SuicideWatch,False,"I wanted a place to put this and also a way to share my experience as a survivor of suicide.

I attempted suicide last year and since then I look back on that day a lot. I attempted suicide by removing my hammock from the hook on the ceiling and attaching a cord/rope to it and started to hang. I yelled at my parents just before so about 1/2 minutes later they came in when I was hanging. I still remember the feeling of regret for not barricading the door in that moment. I am not sure if I would have the balls to not undo the knot though, even if they did not go in. I am still debating if I really wanted to or if it would have worked. I was then taken to a mental hospital for like a week which was very scary and a bit traumatic for me. Anyway, if you want more info about that DM me. now onto the reasons to keep living, this is meant to be the things I have thought about and the reasons I have to live. Now, let me start the list. the list will go from most common reasons to least common at the end.

1. Your family will be sad : This is a very common thing I hear a lot of people say is a reason to live, and for some people it can be the one reason they have to keep going. I  know if you have a shitty family like some people in my family, this may not help however.
2. You could traumatize somebody else : I have not seen many people talk about this but it is still worth talking about this high up on the list. I had my great uncle who committed suicide by gun and it traumatized the people who saw it. He did not want to hurt anyone and in my opinion, he just wanted a way out. The person who finds you will likely never live that down and may feel extreme guilt or sadness.
3. Look at possibilities : I know you probably feel like it could never get worse. Maybe you think everybody else who feels like you has already committed suicide or is planning it. I am here to tell you that the world has over 7.5 billion people and chances are somebody just like you with almost the exact same circumstances is planning something just like you. I always think that there is at least one person who had it worse and survived. Try to imagine the worst situation in your head whatever that looks like, and then look back at yourself. This has helped me several times as my thoughts never really stopped after my attempt.
4. Why the rush? : This one is self explanatory. Why is it so urgent to do it now. You will die anyway so why not wait another week, month, year to see if things get better. Imagine that seed of hope that could impact you in a good way. Who knows, it may even happen tomorrow.
5. What if your enemy dies after you : this one may be rare, but I tend to always go back to this point as a reason to keep living. Try this, visualize the one person you hate more than anything and imagine how they would feel in a world without you. Think of what they would do and say if you died. They may be better off without you and that may give you motivation to keep going.
6. Life may be pointless  (This one really depends on religion and may only apply to some people so just a warning) : Let's say you believe life is pointless and nothing really matters, why kill yourself? Why not try to get the best experience you can despite how small that may be and what is the harm in doing that?

Life is complicated and I hope these points help at least a little bit. Even if they did not, I hope you at least considered them. I may make more of these if this resonates with you all. I am willing to bet you all are good people in some way and we need more of them in the world. I love you all.

Sincerely, Michael"

1373,Is This Considered Suicidal Ideation?,w2xzdj,Anonymousthroaway420,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2xzdj/is_this_considered_suicidal_ideation/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I don’t think I am historically prone to depression. I’ve always had it pretty easy and life has almost always worked out in my favor. My life isn’t perfect but I never hated my life.

I was in a 2.5 year relationship with a woman that I was in love with. Our relationship was very tumultuous. She broke up with me and I don’t blame her - we lived together for 7 months and it wasn’t compatible.

After she broke up with me, I was pretty depressed and anxious. But I had hope I could lift myself out of the depression. 

She told me she was receptive to things in the future and she still loved me. We talked most days and hung out once a week for the next two months while I tried to win her back. Then, while I was in a foreign country, she texted me that she was done and to stop talking to her. She said some horrible things to me (go fuck yourself, I don’t care about your mental health, your existence bothers me, etc). I never got any real in-person conversation for closure. 

I am devastated in a way that I did not realize was possible. I have spent almost every day the past 100+ days sobbing, crying hysterically, confused and hurt beyond belief. I am unable to find joy in almost anything and struggle with basic things like eating. The past 3 months have gone up in smoke and are a blur. 

When I get overwhelmed, thinking that I cannot handle this level of sadness and wondering if it will ever end, I often find myself telling myself “I’ll just fucking kill myself”. I find that the option to end the pain brings me a level of comfort. It’s a way of reminding myself that there is actually an end to suffering. 

But here’s the thing: I don’t think I actually want to die. I know it’s a permanent “solution” that I can never take back. I do not want to ruin my family,  and I do not want to traumatize whoever finds me. But I do use the option as comfort. 

Would this be considered passive suicidal ideation? Anybody have advice bringing this up to a therapist? I am obviously hesitant because I know how serious it is. I feel like I should bring it up so I can nip it in the bud. 

TL;DR
I am severely depressed after a traumatic breakup. I soothe myself by reminding myself that I can kill myself. Is this suicidal ideation? How do I tell my therapist?"
1374,im confused,w2xu53,Em0tinallyRetarded,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2xu53/im_confused/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"Im 17 and im just confused on how to act, i have bags under my eyes that are so bad because i cant sleep from being to scared to be by myself and get stuck with my thoughts thats so overwhelming i can almost hear it like someone else is in the room with me, it makes me zone out and just dive deeper and deeper untill i realize im having a panic attack because im breathing hard and my chest is about to explode.

All i think about every second of every day is that everyone and everything is gonna die and time will cover everything with no mercy at all or guilt. 

Nothing will matter to anything from a bug to entire galaxies. Its all just another death waiting to happen. How do i  live if all i think about is death? 

Even if i was at a birthday party or at the store or at school its always on my mind, like a poison thats incurable because its not a disease or disorder like ptsd or depression its something i figured out when i was a kid, for as long as i remember its all i think about. 

And i have such i high sense of reality all the time im never not thinking, never careless or bliss. My mind is always talking. Every single second and the only way for it to stop is to smoke weed or whatever i become half retard and have giggle fits with my only friend its horrible, the only way im able to really smile genuinely is if im taking sum sort of drug or if im drinking.
Actually on second thought drinking is horrible it makes me think more emotional instead of constantly having an existential crisis every second which ig is still better, id rather feel really sad or anything because tbh i dont feel anything, i feel like i just dont feel anymore. Im not happy,sad,mad or anything. Just fear. Just me and my thoughts telling me im going to die someday so nothing matters, why not just end it now instead of just dragging my life out as long as possible? 

My mind never sleeps, as long as im awake my mind is constantly talking and talking and talking and it makes me feel so damn mentally exhausted to never not be thinking about death and killing myself. And its almost ironic too, socially im super happy and make everyone laugh buts its all just a mask because its the closest ill get to being happy, as long as i see someone genuinely smile it makes me a me happy for a moment and i genuinely smile, no one would ever think all i do is cry and have panic attacks but its all i do. 
No one would even have a reason to guess if i want to kill myself but its on my mind every single day. 

It makes me feel like no one knows me out of all the people in my entire life, out of all 17 years no one knows how i feel and ive accepted it all i want now is to know someone else now its strange youd think id want someone to know me but i just want to have a strong relationship with someone ig like a gf but even my own bestfriend atm couldnt believe i have panic attacks after he saw my recommended searches on google about if tylenol will help with panic attacks because it supposedly removes not only physical but emotional pain too. 

I just want to think about small stuff like school and a job and not this death shit. i just want to sleep yk, im just tired. I just want to lay down and go to sleep. I just wanna not care for once"

My parents announced a divorce that February and I was broken. I still regret that decision to this day because I feel, in retrospect, that if I wasn’t so weak I could’ve barely managed to pass the year.

This January, I enlisted in a small low-key “school” that had ensured regular teaching but it turned out that they only taught 3 of my 7 subjects. In March, I left the school and decided to do online. I regret the beginning of this year because I was belligerent enough to look past the obvious short comings of the school.

I decided I’d do online and supplement myself with regular tutors. On one occasion, a tutor had to cancel our session and I got a rush of excitement because I “didn’t have to do any work that day”. As a result, I regularly cancelled organized sessions and am now barely scraping through my second attempt at my final year of school. I regret being so childish and blind.

My June exams were a disaster. I failed the easiest subject because in my personal history, I never had to study for it until this occasion. I regret being an idiot and thinking I could take the easy path through this year. 

I have recently found out that I have missed a year-long project for the same subject I failed in June. It is a very easy project and I managed to screw it up. I regret assuming that I didn’t have to do it because in all honesty I just didn’t want to do it. 

And now I’m here typing this, wishing that I wasn’t such a wimp, liar, sloth, loser, pothead, smoker - you get the point. 

I know that all I have ever done and all I will ever continue to do is disappoint people. People who always tell me “You haven’t disappointed anyone.” Whether that’s a lie, I know I’ll end up disappointing people at the end of the year. 

My mom is sick of me being so negative; I feel like I can’t vent to her anymore.

I know I’ll never be as fit, proud, successful and happy as my dad. 

I know my sister will be superior to me because of her good grades and zest for life.

I know I will never be the hero my sister sees me as because I’m too unmotivated to even walk the dogs with her.

If I can’t be as great as anyone around me, why be around at all?

My uncle tells me I’m a brilliant writer but it’s not like I want to write. I want to get into information design but I strongly doubt I’ll be accepted into university. 

I’m bed ridden pretty much everyday and have no interest in being physically active even though I complain about being in slightly worse shape than I ever have been.

I believe I’m aromantic (I don’t feel compelled to date or have a romantic relationship) so I can miss meeting a special someone goodbye. 

I basically feel like my whole life has been some kind of sick joke with the punch line being to slowly degrade my self image. 

I know that if I were to kill myself I’d overdose because it’s quiet and clean.

The only reason I’m not killing myself is because of my family. 

I have severe depression, anxiety and ADHD. I’ve never once felt mentally sound and I shudder to imagine a long life of hating myself.

I have all of these problems and all the desire in the world to change myself but not an iota of motivation, energy or willpower to act on it. I’m a walking failure to myself and least of all my family. 

I’ve tried losing some weight. I’m 5’8, naturally built and used to hover around 75kg. In late May I started eating like a dickhead and gained at least 10kg. Now I’m stuck at 86kg and hating how I look in spite of my mom’s affirmations that I look completely fine.

The only belief I have is that I can’t be great. I’m a talented scuba diver but am consciously deciding to confine myself within my home. 

I hate everything I do, all the decisions I make, my daily routine, my appearance, my grades. I’m losing touch with my friends because they’re so much further ahead of me at university with great potential. 

Why do people tell me I’m so much better than I believe when I cannot convince myself otherwise. 

Sometimes when I’m really depressed, I stub out cigarettes on my body to punish myself and to feel a pain that isn’t in my head. I wish I could do it with every cigarette I smoke but I’d just embarrass myself with the scars. 

I got my drivers license on my first try a day after one of my worst depressive states and am not proud of it at all. I feel nothing. Even though I told everyone I’d pass first time, I had no sense of accomplishment when that came to be. 

I want to sleep forever, maybe even dream forever. Not be dead, but also not be able to think. Either way, I don’t deserve the life I’ve born into. 

My dad has all the money in the world but I’m just a waste of it. I’m intelligent but have nothing to show for it. I’m good looking but hate my appearance. I love my family but want to run away. I love my friends but I’m inferior to their accomplishments. 

Why am I still here."

This will be a REALLY lengthy post.



Oh, where to start. I've been struggling for awhile now. Well, to say awhile would be pretty optimistic -- it's essentially been with me as far as I remember. The thing I've been struggling with isn't any kind of disorder or anything, even though I severely have ADHD. I'm surprised I even felt like sitting down and writing this, but anxiety can be a powerful tool in the form of productivity.. as bad as it is. 

Anywho, you might be wondering what I've exactly been struggling with? I guess society, really. Unexpected answer, huh? Probably not. But anyways, I have wants and not really any needs -- but practically never an opportunity for them. I want a good job, I get hard labor between 2 jobs at 19. Can't even go to college because I have to work hard and barley afford ridiculous, absurd housing costs. Parents didn't really want me around either. They say otherwise, but knowing them-- it's to save face among relatives. After all, what loving parents punishes you by yelling in your face and placing blame? Mine, apparently. But you may wonder, why not just apply for aid or something? Well, US laws say I'm dependent even though I tried to cut many ties to my parents. They have high income, so I get tiny little aid. It's gonna be like this til laws dictate I'm independent, even though I really am.

To further go on with wants.. I want real life friends. I get temporary friendship. I consider myself extremely social -- I can handle large crowds no issue. Likely due to volunteering for various things very often in high school, often to get my mind off things. Anyways, I'll go to people, introduce myself.. stuff like that. However, every friendship I had ended at some point. I'd always try to either be myself or just be a ""good friend"" but both methods never really worked as intended. Can't even keep fake friends who try to use you, heh.

I also want a relationship. I doubt I need to explain this one, it's a paragraph in a sentence! Haha.

There's more wants, but listing them all will make this thread sound like a begging thread, and that isn't the purpose of it.

Anyways, back to the issue -- society. I've never been able to act like myself. To me, myself has been as normal as can be.. but society dictates it as ""creepy behavior."" I understand it makes people uncomfortable, which is why I wear a mask. Due to me always hiding who I really am, I conveniently picked up a skill where I'll adjust my personality in a blink based on who I'm talking to. Not sure how I got that skill, but I typically get a hint of the kind of people you enjoy after a few sentences. Sounds fake, sounds bogus, but that's partially why I have a throwaway account. Let's me be honest without worrying about people trying to Twitter me, haha. Also something that puts people off is my walk is just like Aristotle from Billie Bust Up-- little trex hands. I definitely got made fun of for that. Just how I learned to balance, very natural for me.

Examples of how I'd be is one person I'd be the edgy kid with while another I'd be the shy kid to. I do feel guilty tho because it feels like I'm manipulating people-- but it kind of was caused by people to begin with so I guess it cancels each other out? But if you want to know who I am actually, the real me, I'll let y'all know sept this is anonymous. I'm a really handsy person. I have extreme difficulties talking, can't form sounds correctly so it results in a ""slurred"" speech almost.. so to compensate, I start using touch to help communicate. It was all fine throughout elementary, us children hardly care.. but starting around junior high is when people started to be on edge. To further illustrate, here's some examples..
- If I tell someone something important, I talk slow while patting their shoulder. I associate that feeling with attention.
- if I'm happy for someone, I like to hug them.
- if I don't like something someone said, I do a gentle push while explaining my dislike.

See why people get on edge? It should be obvious with the hug part.



But anyways, post is getting really long so I'll stop talking with as much detail and start talking present, sept I got the base info established.


!!! HARD CONTENT, BE WARNED !!!

Getting right to the point, I've been considering suicide for a long time. Ive attempted it twice before, to no success. The first time was simply a gun, but the gun got super conveniently jammed when I attempted. The second was by hanging, but the tree couldn't support the initial force, so I was left with a bruise on my neck. Yet even with a bruise on my neck, no one ever questioned it -- even the high school counselor.. what an easy job for them, apparently.

I just have a strong sense of not fitting it. I cant be myself, I can't work towards my goal, Ive gotten absurdly depressed, the therapist I tried going to just made me more anxious (so now I have a fear of therapy, weird huh?), I'm just trapped in a locked box with a titanium seal. 
- I want to be myself, but it's seen as creepy and will always be. 
- I want to go to college, but can't no matter how hard I try. I can't afford to be in debt because I'm too scarred about how the housing market will be after graduation.
- I want a good job instead of 2 awful ones. At least I'm employee of the month in one of them (eye roll).
- I want friends.. too bad I can't keep any.
- I want a relationship, need I say more?

I just want to live but no matter how hard I try to obliterate this wall, it just laughs at me back and gets stronger!

The reason I've yet to attempt a third time is hugely thanks to ASMR RP, laugh now I'll wait. Audios of people roleplaying stories, my preferred one is comfort-based ones. Like someone pretending to be your lover and cuddles up to you.. with the audio you can hear stuff like their heartbeat while they say reassuring things. It's kept me strong so far but for how long, who knows.

I've already planned a third attempt though, won't post the date nor strategy. Even as I was typing this, it was really hard to avoid tears. Why must life revolve around static perfection? Isn't there any room for an outcast?

At least I'm really good at programming, so I'll probably do that while waiting for the day."

I always thought that was stupid. Who doesn’t want there life to go on and on. Well I don’t. The world is lonely and cruel a lot. I have an ex wife that holds onto my kids and rarely lets them see me. She’s not the worst person on the planet but she’d make a good runner up. I despise my job. My current spouse and my relationship has suddenly collapsed in the last 2 months. Absolutely the love of my life.  We’ve battled and always come back together. Said we’d always be together. The worst is not knowing. Actually the worst is the longing. It’s exhausting. It’s all pain. If I didn’t have kids I’d have done it by now. And then I think that’s such a weak way to go. Toughen up. I don’t know. It would be so much easier. Write some letters. Drive somewhere quiet. Get it over with. Then I think about not being there for my kids. It’s heartbreaking.

I was diagnosed with add asd and depression when I was 8 and younger. It was a lot of hard work for me and my family to help me get better bc of my disability. I tried to kill myself when I was a kid. I was on medication and experimental drugs for most of my child hood while seeing doctors of all sorts. I got better and wasn’t feeling so bad, I was able to find friends when I was a bit older and that felt good. But for some reason I’m feeling extremely depressed again and wanting to kill myself. Idk weather or not I should bc it just keeps getting worse. And I struggle enough as it is with everything like trying to find a job or just talking to people. It takes me years to feel comfortable with someone and there’s not many people that I have.

i feel so selfish and i feel so annoying. i’m filled with so much rage and hate all of the time but i have no idea how to confront it or address it. i’m constantly getting into fist fights with my family and i go through friends like gold fish.

i’ve been hardly eating anymore. most days i feel like i’m only laying in bed an staring at my ceiling. i have daydreams about literally just dropping dead so i don’t have to suffer through this any more. the truth is? i really couldn’t care less if my family was upset about it. i’m selfish. just like them. they have never once in my life cared to even try and understand what’s happening in my brain. except my dad. but he’s dead. the only one i’m worried about is my girlfriend.

i’m worried i won’t even be able to be enough for my girlfriend right now. i think it was a bad idea to be with her. she is such an amazing and sweet girl. she puts a smile on my face when i get like this or when i have spikes in my mental. but i had an explosive, messy breakup about a year and a half ago. as dumb as that is. i’m still really fucked up over it. like, really fucked up. i do not view this former partner in a romantic way any longer and in any capacity. let me make that very, very clear.. but the things that they did and said to me were the most vile and heinous things i have ever experienced before. i still think about those things every day. and i get so concerned. that my girlfriend would be subjected to all of my baggage. i love her so much. and i’ve been transparent about my trauma. but i still get so worried. i’m so used to people simply picking up and leaving the second i open my mouth.

i’m tired of these stupid fucking therapists asking me the same 5 questions. i’m tired of always being doped up on god knows what “anti-anxiety” they decide to toss me for the month. i’m tired of nothing working for me and feeling like absolute shit all the time. they’re always telling me to keep my head up but it keeps getting shoved back underneath.

I didn’t know your muscle separated/ torn of the bone. If I knew this then I would have decided not to have children. I googled childbirth a lot when I was pregnant because I was worried and I found many articles saying the vagina will be the same after birth and sex will feel the same. This put my mind at rest.

Now I have major muscle damage and nerve damage and have never enjoyed sex again. I will never have an orgasm again. I can feel all the broken muscle and have constant stinging pain from nerve damage.

Sex is very important to me and it has now gone, so I have decided to end my life. 

My mother had 3 prolapses so I guess it is in my genes. The doctors should give woman with family history of muscle avulsion c-sections as this could save their body/ life/ happiness/ relationship.

My sister have the same genes as me and they had caesareans so they managed to escape the generational curse and because of this they are very happy with their lives. 

I have cried everyday for 4 years. I was confused as I didn’t know what was wrong with me, so I visited the doctor many times but nobody told me the truth. I got there is nothing wrong with you, get over it, you’re never going to change, this is who you are now, it’s normal, get used to it, do more kegels. I have been laughed at me more than once. 

Women deserve to be warned about the risk of childbirth so they can make a decision based on their values.

I left, broke down despite knowing how stupid all this is. I punched my thigh and left to go home by bus. It was an agonizingly long bus ride, I thought of how I could hurt myself at home and shit, and then I thought of how many pills I had there.

For those who didn't know, twenty leaves of that shit, no matter if dried or boiled, are enough to kill a horse. 
Very low chances of surviving.

Now, I wanted to share this because I know not many people are aware of the toxicity of oleanders (though I did read some articles about suicide attempts involving its consumption), and also because I feel like I'm a genius coming up with something like that – very confident, not my usual.


Some background information if you've made it this far: 
this isn't my first attempt, no one ever discovered about my past suicide attempts. I promised I would do it before September: life's not all good, family situation is very toxic, on top of it all I'm going to lose a whole year soon - my parents are ready to disown me. I have no intention of doing the admission exams either. Hopelessness kicked in I guess.

I've been feeling depressed for a long time, and tried to unalive myself for other reasons before too.

Might be a bit disjointed and weird but this is kind of a thought record. 

Behind the loss of will to live, is that life is not worth living because it is full of suffering. Below may be an incomplete summary of the issues i'm facing, i've found it useful to organize them by the negative emotions that cause me to think of suicide. 

ANGER/INJUSTICE

Part of my suffering comes from an accumulation of injustice that I have suffered in the past, which I won't go into detail. But I think i've felt let down by people in authority, people who do bad things to others, people who seem to care so little about the well-being of others but get away with it all the time. I feel that some of you may have gone through something similar, but I guess we all think of suicide for different reasons. 

another part of my suffering comes from my constant rumination of said events, 

Another reason is also being unable or unwilling to accept injustice. It comes from a primal place of ""if I allow or am ok with this injustice to occur, the world is not a safe place."" I think this kinda forms one of the basis of society. From stories I've heard, injustice seems to be a part of life.  and it is unavoidable as sad as it sounds. Perhaps some people are able to live with injustice. Somehow i've magnified it to envelop my world view. I need to some how let go of my vision of a perfect world where there is no injustice without becoming apathetic to it. 

ANXIETY

related to the above construct of anger, I feel a sense of anxiety or almost paranoia whenever i'm going out into the world. There's a fear that someone will just do something violent or aggressive towards me. There's also the anxiety related to acts of nature which may or may not occur that could cause serious trauma to myself. 

Aside from that, there is also the fear of harm befalling someone close to me whether caused by another person or accident, and the grief and sadness that will inevitably follow.

DEPRESSION

Weirdly enough, I do not have much to write about depression, perhaps because this is related to Anger and Anxiety. There are two things that are creating this sense of depression within myself, the first being so angry at injustice yet being unable to do anything about it, causes the anger to turn inwards and creates a sense of helplessness; I cannot save myself because the bad guys always win. The second is related to anxiety; I believe something catastrophic is going to happen to me or my loved ones which creates a sense of pessimism. 

SHAME/ GUILT

despite my rantings about injustice, i'm sure that I must have been guilty of some. In my effort to ""right the wrongs"" and take justice into my own hands, i'm sure I may have inadvertently hurt others. As a result of growing up in an education system rampant with bullying, to survive I would likely have bullied, as well as been bullied. Things which I am not proud of and hate myself for. I have also done alot of embarassing stuff and I know everyone does it but they are most painfully aware to myself. 

BIOLOGY

Being an introvert I feel that I am much more emotionally reactive than others. As the amygdala is linked to the hippocampus (one is an area of the brain that lights up in response to negative emotions and the other is in charge of memory formation), the experience of many emotionally charged events also means that I am able to recall them with ease; therefore i am prone to rumination. It is also difficult for me to react appropriately to current events as the past often has strong effects on the present when I link what is happening in the present to the past so fluidly.

WHAT IS THE CURE?

man, i think its going to be easier to type it out than actually practice this but here goes:

1. Accept that this is an imperfect world. Be able to take injustice in my stride, (urgh i'm feeling sick as I type this)
2. be kinder to myself, know that I'm just human, and hell, i'm already making an effort to better myself which is pretty commendable. 
3. Accept that suffering is part of life. Tragedies need not destroy you. 
4. Need some thing to be able to reduce my emotional reactiveness, could be medication, or calming exercises, or mindfulness. 
5. An active acknowledgement of the good things in life, being mindful towards them and not forsake them for just the bad/"

This is a hail mary to God and anyone who finds the time to read this. This is also a throwaway account, and I don't know if I'll ever circle back to reply or respond.

I'm a silk thread away from giving up on this life. I finally gained the courage to speak to a therapist, who advised what I already suspected they would recommend for my situation - individual & group therapy, and prescribed medication. However, laying in bed prior to posting this, I couldn't help thinking that maybe taking more than one sleeping pill might be the prescribed cure for this boiling and insurmountable pain I'm experiencing on a mental, physical, and spiritual level.

I'm a single male in his early 30s with nothing to show for in life. I'm lonely, no friends and social anxiety + my current status in life have kept me from attempting to make new ones. I'm fortunate to have a job that is decent for what it is, but not enough to dig myself out of the financial hole I'm in & suffer from imposter syndrome when it comes to my field of choice, one in which I earned a degree and have been involved with for over 20 years. I'm living with my mother, feel less than because of it, and have plans to move out come hell or high water in the next 3-4 months, if I survive this for that long. And if so? I'm still stuck with myself no matter where I go.

I'm severely depressed. I've been dealing with suicidal ideation for the past few weeks, as well as using weed and alcohol as a means of escape (sidenote: this has brought me the most joy I've felt in a long time, but it's substance abuse and not sustainable). I've had to call off work 1-2 days a week for the past 3 weeks (including yesterday) because I can't focus and am losing the drive to continue on. My grandfather passed away a few months ago, and he was the father figure in my life. Family drama and issues have now caused my grandmother to not want to see or speak to me, through no fault of my own & despite us always having had a great relationship otherwise. I feel hurt by it. 

I'm single, have had only one meaningful relationship in my teens, and while there was the prospect of a relationship with someone I've met online, it's don't since stalled due to distance and my inability to feel as if I could truly be myself or open up to anyone. My mental and financial state at the moment also play a factor.

I want the pain to end. I want to have enough money to fix my car.... to get the dental work I need done and lessen the toothache.... to get rid of the constant headaches.... to find the energy, strength, and sheer will to start exercising.... to get rid of the psoriasis.... to be able to start giving back to the world. But mainly, I want the pain to end.

I don't want to kill myself. But if there was a button to press to end it all in one fell swoop, I think I would push it. Or maybe I wouldn't, which is why I'm writing this in the first place. A few years ago, after realizing death wouldn't come from my own hand, I sought to destroy myself instead. I did things contrary to my nature, morals and ethics, and truly sought to debase myself. I slowly decided life was worth living.... but I suppose thise thoughts never really left.

I don't know what this post is meant to represent - a mile marker on my way to recovery? a plea to God that somehow this unabashed honestly will grant absolution and mercy? a plea to this community in hopes that someone somewhere will say the right thing at the right time to tip the scales? 

It was either write this post, or cry myself to sleep and hope I don't wake my mother up. Now that it's been written... it still may happen. I may not survive the day, week, month, year. Or maybe I'll finally attain the life my grandfather had, long and fruitful with a large and loving family and community who respected him. Either way, at least this post will serve as proof that I can be brutally honest with myself, that I do not like who I have become, that I have a desire to change, and that I have no energy, determination, or support to see it happen.

For anyone who did read this, thank you. Be kind to others, and do no harm."

In August of 2021, I got hit with a bad case of HFMD. I was in school, walking around and just being in school until i felt nauseous and high. I texted my mom to come get me, thinking I was just high because of my higher dose of antidepressants. I vomited on the way home and stayed nauseous. Around 12 am I told my mom that I felt worse and was in a lot of pain. We went to the ER and they diagnosed me with HFMD and give us medicine. The HFMD was so bad I became bedridden until September when we went to the ER again. 

I no longer had HFMD but was in so much pain I couldn't walk or sleep on my side. Since then I've been VERY slowly getting better, and am now mostly in a wheelchair but can walk. My doctors have no idea what's going on in my body, even after an MRI. I also have two new allergies to mold and mildew, one that gives me excess saliva and acid reflux so bad that I cant eat for at least 20 hours straight without throwing it back up. The other causes me to swell in the area affected, normally my finger tips and mouth. 

Before this, I was healthy and doing marching band, going on walks, and riding my bike everyday. I went from healthy and normal to not being able to walk or get out of bed within 24 hours. My mental health has declined and I might not be able to return to my normal highschool next year. I'm constantly depressed, thinking of what used to be my life. Progress is so slow and I already had mental problems before this. I've thought about suicide more this month alone than I did an entirety of 2021. Everything takes the energy out of me and everyday i have an allergic reaction. 

I don't know how to be happy unless I'm completely distracted from my surroundings, and that's usually interrupted by intrusive thoughts. I don't know what to do, I thought maybe ranting about it would help and it did a bit. Maybe Reddit could help me. 

 I'm 16 and feel like my life is over before it even started. I've attempted suicide multiple times in the past with failure each time. 

I want to kill myself.

im just fighting my own mind while im conscious, although the meds dull it a bit. i dont want to be on them my whole life because they dull most things. im sorry. im really fucking sorry but ive lost years of my life to my fucking brain. i just want peace. i dont wanna hurt anymore, or hurt anyone else. im sorry. i think ill go on a walk tomorrow and try to find somewhere tall, or just go in the river. ill bring some razors in case i chicken out.

im so tired of holding up, of saying the same things, hearing the same things, feeling the same things. there's not even a me in here anymore. i miss being very little when i felt alive. i just need to end this torment.

i love you guys, i love all of you so so much"
1457,I give up.,w2eel1,Otaku_trash_prince,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2eel1/i_give_up/,9,SuicideWatch,True,"No one gives a fuck. I’m worthless and I don’t deserve anything. I’m tired of the guilt and self loathing. I’m tired of always caring about everyone. I’ve tried to be selfish, I’ve tried to not care, I’ve tried saying what I feel. But I just can’t. I ended up spending all my money on others, giving things away, constantly feeling guilty for asking for anything even if I desperately want it or need something. I can’t stop thinking about everyone else and asking about their days first, turning every conversation back to them…asking questions, being as polite and nice as I can be…I HATE IT! I HATE MYSELF! I hate that I can’t even be myself! That I’ve been beaten into this people pleaser and selfless fucking idiot! I’m a god damn masochist! I swear to fuck I’m a fucking mess. I let everyone just look over me like I’m nothing…I can’t say anything I want to out of fear that I’ll be hated. I can’t lose what little I have. I’m tired of not being taken seriously, ignored, or just brushed off…and being fine with that. I FUCKING KNOW ITS NOT OK! I know I deserve better…that I deserve things like everyone else. That I deserve love, understanding, and compassion. I deserve a voice. I DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BOUNDARIES AND SHIT! I DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY “NO” and not be ashamed…I know this. I know I shouldn’t punish myself for not feeling like I’m enough, or worthy. But I can’t stop thinking about disappearing. How much better it’ll be. I can’t look in the mirror anymore without wanting to rip at my flesh…picking out everything that isn’t good enough to be the son they deserve, the brother they can depend on, the uncle they look up to, the friend who is irreplaceable…I’ll never be anything but ashamed. I’m a burden and I can’t do anything right. I can’t change…I’ve tried so hard to be the sweet, funny, punk ass, masochistic, little pet, desperate for any kind of attention that I am. But it’s only gotten me yelled at and threatened when I say “no”, questioned on why I’m even trying, told to kill myself when I opened up and was honest, betrayed and left behind…even as I am now it’s all the same thing, just a different dance…”if I keep everyone happy then they won’t hurt me.” A constant lie I feed myself. I’m done…I’ve been scoffed at when I had a belt around my neck and in tears…told to “stop being dramatic”…I watched people I loved die. I lost people who actually understood me. I saw things that I wish I didn’t, I know secrets that fucking rip me apart, I’ve had things happen to me that I’m so scared and ashamed to utter to anyone because I don’t know if im aloud to be upset about it. I just want to go to sleep forever and stop being such a problem. I just want to be happy. I want my smile back, my happy cry, that pounding in my chest and flush in my cheeks when I watched my favorite concert dvds, that contentment knowing that I was ok and someone out there would love me. Now everything is bleak and empty, I cry when I’m alone so no one can hear me, I’m grateful for masks…I don’t have to fake smile so much anymore, all I think about is “how can I disappear and still be useful?” It’s so stupid…I’ve already started self harming again just to feel something besides sadness and emptiness. Just end me…I’m useless."

I love the idea of being free not be burdened by the daily tasks of capitalism and consumerism I hate the fact that the government and big corporations take advantage of everybody the way people mystery animals and nature itself that nobody has any trust or self-respect anymore. I hate the fact that the medical industry would rather let people die just for profit if I get sick I’m not going to the doctor I don’t wanna be another statistic I don’t wanna be another number and I hate the way that I have to be stuck in a rat race from the day of my birth I don’t wanna job that supports my existence I just want to exist freely I don’t like how the government uses my money to do things that are beyond horrible I don’t wanna support any of it what should I just walk away from society? I tried killing myself about three months ago and I’ve noticed that my family my mom my dad my brothers and sisters didn’t even notice for two days I had to call them and tell them when they wanted to act like they cared the way everyone pretends to be is this the way they are or the way society made them? Or do they actually care about me or if they just been conditioned to think like that? The fact that people can do horrific things to each other or in general and get away with it for years decades or their entire lives and never see any type of consequence is disgusting I wish Covid was doing more to wipe out the human species and I don’t wanna be a part of it. I was in a car accident and I wholeheartedly wish it killed me. As days go by I see more of all the things I hate and I can’t help but thank that seven year old boy was right. I look at people like Chris McCandles or the man that walked away from society and lived out in the woods for 25 years and can’t help but think that these people have been the most free out of anybody in the last 200 years. I don’t want to do it because I’m sad lonely or empty I think back to philosophy and think the only way to win is not to play

I'd say I felt even more guilty. I was the oldest, it was supposed to be my burden and sacrifice. But maybe that's just f\*\*\*ed up.

I know some people here will be nice and say ""You can talk to me if you want"" but I actually want to talk with my closest people (family) not strangers (sorry) including random therapist.

I have a decent job. I have a few good friends. I have people interested in me. But every day I spiral. I've been hiding in the bathroom and crying hysterically on my breaks at work. Last night I drank and self-harmed. I went to bed with it still bleeding and woke up to the bed being bloody and it... still bleeding. It was quite tender and I reluctantly dragged myself out of bed. I was late to work because I've been sleeping through ALL my 10+ alarms and have been sleeping through loud knocking, my two large dogs barking incessantly, etc.

 I was already a mess and then I of course was hit by terrible abdominal cramps and diarrhea. I have not had a decent BM in days and I suppose it finally all hit me today. I called out of work. I hate myself. My bathroom problems seem funny when I talk about them but it's actually exhausting. Some days I'm in so much pain that I think more about killing myself to get it to stop (I think about killing myself every day in general but the pain makes the thoughts worse). 

I don't like my life. I don't have much motivation. I recently stopped birth control because I thought that it was possibly making my suicidal thoughts worse but I suppose it may have been making my suicidal thoughts better. And now I'm suicidal over the fact that I was ""stupid"" and decided to stop it. I know that I couldn't have known but part of my brain says otherwise and I berate myself. 

I can't stand this. I don't like what's going on with my body and mind. I'm over it. I'm so drained. I've been thinking of going to the mental hospital but I'm terrified because I have been utterly traumatized by homicidal people who I had had the misfortune of befriending. I can't deal with being re-traumatized if any other patient were to say or do anything to me at the hospital. It would 100% send me over the edge. All of the hospitals near me mix suicidal and homicidal people together and take cellphones. I worry that if anything were to happen and I wanted to leave that they wouldn't let me contact anyone.

They want me to go from a day program to residential and I'm choosing to discontinue treatment. 

I can't take the pain anymore and I'm just so tired. I can't fight anymore. I can probably lose 20 or so more lbs on top of the 30+lost before I die. 2 or 3 months at most. 

Then there's a quicker method. Research done, a plan formed, 2 test runs to perfect the plan, note written. I just have to do it and I'll go to sleep. 

People are worried about me and are scared I'm going to die from anorexia. They've watched me fade away, shocked when they see me in person. They say I'm sick, but I've just found a solution. I should spare them the extra few months and just do it now. They'll be fine without me either way I go."

also i think i just want someone to understand why i would kill myself, because im always afraid that people will think i did it for some stupid reason.

TLDR; life sucks, my mom sucks, i wanna write it all out because i just dont see the point in living anymore.

i started feeling this way when i was 12 (im 20 now). middle school was really hard for me, sometimes in ways that i don't know how to articulate. i've been told by some people that i'm pretty and funny and that people like being around me, and when i look back i guess i see some moments where that could be true. but it never felt that way. i've always had this sense that something was wrong with me. what makes it hard for me to articulate is that i feel like i know exactly why i felt that way- my mom made it very clear that she was not interested in raising me. she mostly just wanted me to be quiet and pretty and not cause her any problems while she gave all of her attention to my brother. i dont have anything against him but this + him being a little asshole my entire life has made it hard for us to have a relationship. but anyways any time i ""acted out"", like speaking up for myself, cried, expressed interest in anything, one time even just stop her from hitting me, and generally everything that makes comes with being a person with needs, she would go to the extreme to try to put me down. ive been told my whole life that i annoy my friends, im too close to some people (and never close enough to the people she liked), and that in general my mom is the most important person in my life. i should be working hard to be emulate her. i think i genuinely hate her though. 

its hard because i dont love her but i am an overly empathetic person. i would be fine if i never spoke to her again, and i would actually probably be better off- but i can never do it. she calls and asks about me too much. she wants me to be around- but only if i agree to be her quiet, conservative daughter. and i dont mean that politically necessarily, but she doesnt like it when i wear specific clothing or color my hair or get piercings or any of that sort of thing. this sucks because i love color, and i do all the things she doesnt like anyways and i think she loves me less because of it. but i put up with all of it because i would feel bad if she died or something and she would easily find a way to make me a bad guy in all of it. and shes the only connection i have to my family, but she kept me and my brother away from her family, who we used to be extremely close to (like my cousins were basically my other siblings) because of some argument she had with my aunts, and even though theyve relatively recently gotten over it, i feel like i basically have no relationship with any of them. they clearly dont know anything about me and are only mildly interested. fair i guess. they all got to grow up together, im not good at keeping up with people. im basically a stranger. 

we got into an argument this summer where she told me that shes angry at me for never calling because it ""seems like i dont want to have a relationship with her"" and that its my fault that we were never close growing up ever since she noticed that i had depression when i was 9. that hit me hard because i always, at least, gave her the benefit of the doubt that she never knew how depressed i was as a child and just thought i was shy or something. but no. she just took antidepressants herself but didnt like them so she didn't take me to get help. mind you she has a masters in psychology and was a social worker at the time. i remember being depressed way earlier though. my parents divorced when i was 5. i remember my mom yelling at my dad to get out of the house. i remember her crying- it made me cry too. she seemed very annoyed at the fact that i was also crying. looking back on that moment i understand her distress but dont understand why she would do that in front of her young kids. i remember changing after that. of course it was a long time ago so obviously i changed, but i used to be a much more outgoing kid. i used to like being outside and playing. i didnt have any sort of social life living with my mom. when my parents divorced i had no say in who i got to stay with. if i did get that choice i would have picked my dad without question. i think my little brother would have too if he could. i dont know how much better my dad would have been but at least i know he wouldnt call the cops on me when he got mad. he has also not really liked me though. its kind of like a toned down version of my mom. he goes out of his way to say he loves me and is proud of me, but got annoyed when i wasnt exactly how he wanted me to be. he is super unhygenic and it really pisses me off. and i lived with him for a year to get away from my mom but his wife was just as abusive and he didnt want to do anything about it out of fear of being single. i feel like ive inherited that. i can never have kids because i dont know that i can raise them any better than i was raised. 

some other grievances with life in general:

\- i have a medical condition that some people deem 'desirable'. basically it affects my appearance in a way that makes people harass me constantly. even my mom. it makes me uncomfortable to go outside at all, because it gets mentioned always.

\- im so fucking poor. my dad apparently has money but he doesnt give me shit. my college makes me consider his financial information for aid and so its super high and i have to pay it myself so i dont know if im going to be able to continue with school anymore. and bc of this i am dependent on my mom

\- i was supposed to study abroad this summer but i wasnt even allowed on the plane for a really BS reason. so now im out of the money for the plane ticket ($1200 that took me years to save) and i have to either pay it all again to go next year or lose my $1000 deposit. 

\- my grandpa died while i was trying to figure all the stuff out with my plane ticket

\- im currently homeless and living with my sister because theres just not enough space for me and my mom in my grandma's house.

\- i found i wasnt going abroad too late in the summer so now no one will hire me. 

\- i cant express any negative thoughts to any professional because last time i did i was put in an all-day outpatient therapy thing and it was alright but now it would affect my life if i got committed or something so i have to just suffer in silence. 

\- i live like a hermit now. i dont go outside most days. i either eat too much or too little and always just feel bad. despite the freedom from living with my mom i cant shake the habit of self isolating and wasting away in silence and im afraid its already too late for me to learn to do otherwise. and now even when im with people i feel alone.

\- i see my sister live her life and shes so well put together it hurts. she has a lot of friends and goes and does a lot of things with them. i have friends and even a boyfriend who i love dearly but i feel like i can never been 100% comfortable with another person. she doesnt get that. shes so open. my mom was her stepmom and my sister hated her. every time i tell her something about my mom, she tells me that my mom used to do the same to her. it hurts because it feels like she got out and left me behind. 

\- the dumbest stupidest thing: i have an intense fear of roaches. when i was growing up our apartment was infested with them. i cannot be around a roach in any capacity without eventually having a panic attack. this especially goes for the really big ones. but i keep finding them in my sisters apartment. i found 3 today in the bathroom and immediately started panicking. i was on the phone with my boyfriend which made it slightly better but he had to leave. i called my mom after bc the big roach chased me out of the bathroom and i was sobbing in the bedroom & my sister isnt home and idk i guess i just wanted someone to calm me down. my mom yelled at me for crying and then yelled at me for asking her to please stop yelling bc she was just making me feel worse. i tried calling some other people after that but they didnt respond and i dont want to call anyone else and bother them or have them think something about me. i have to pee :(

i feel dumb because i feel like when people grow up super repressed they usually talk about feeling numb or dead inside or something. but i feel like i feel everything. i feel the weight of my entire life on my shoulders. every time i think about it i cry uncontrollably. if i tell anyone about my childhood i always end up telling them too much and i think it creeps them out a bit.

sorry for rambling. writing all this for other people to see has made me feel a little bit better, but i know the feeling is gonna come back because it always comes back so that sucks. 

am i being overdramatic about all this??? does anyone else go through all this and end up normal?? does this feeling ever go away??"

That being said, when she told me it honestly broke my heart and it saddens me deeply that she feels this way and there is nothing I can do to remedy it.

I was wondering if it would be possible that you guys could help me out with giving me questions I could ask her without sounding like such a healthcare provider. I'd love some questions that are more personable and make her feel like I genuinely care which I really do, I just don't know how to ask to be honest since I just know mental health assessment questions. I really want her to know I am here for you and that she can always rely on me to be an ear to listen and be a comfort. I get that talking about ones sadness and suicidal thoughts is not easy especially to a loved on as you don't want to scare them or have them consistently worry.

I just want to be able to ask her question that make her feel like I'm not treating her like a patient or illness. I want her to gradually be able to open up to me and be comfortable talking to me about the ideation and so forth.

She also can not talk to her family about it, nor do I believe she is willing to seek medical attention due to financial reasons.

Please any questions that some of you may have wanted to be ask when you had ideation or questions that feel like I care but don't want to sound to parental etc.

I just want her to know that she is loved very deeply and that I'd always be there for her through really tough times and she wouldn't have to face them alone.

TLDR; Questions to ask my S/O about suicidal ideation and thoughts without sounding like a Psych or Parent. Something that is very personable and shows shes loved and is always cared for."

Sorry for any mistakes I commit, English is not my first language. 

I'm from Spain, and since childhood I've had it rough. I wasn't so popular between my classmates. I spent almost every day since age 3 'til age 15 alone, with no much companies. I've got frustrated for no having friends or someone whom I could talk to, I didn't have any support from my parents, I've got the the laughs of my classmates and they spelled rumours about me and I've got my grades worsened because of the related. I was one of the highest marks in my class, and they all went to 0 of a sudden.

I tried to kill myself at age 15 (2017) and got hospitalised. Spent three weeks in hospital, and after that, I felt enough to keep on. 

At that time I met my first girlfriend, and it went along for a year, until she cheated on me and sent me very explicit pics of her having sex with his lover. This, of course, let me traumatised, one more trauma to add to that mountain I mentioned a while ago, and with several trust issues with everyone I've met since then. Got diagnosed with paranoia for this. Started to hear laughs outside of school and voices telling me how fool I look. Thankfully, they disappeared with time, although occasionally they come back.

This finally caused me to left high school (2018). I wasn't strong and I was too much of a coward to face day-to-day after this. Suicidal tendencies came back again, but didn't go further as 2017. That time I didn't seek help for my parents not to worry —they are very doubtful of mental health problems—.

Fortunately, months after (2019), I found a group of friends while surfing around some forums related to my city. And that's how I met my very first true friends, we met up and went for some coffee, we discovered many places and we had unstoppable gaming evenings. A good part of this group and I worked at a bar of a member that was facing economic problems, even. We were like 40 people. And everyone knew about each other, we were doing fine. 

Of those forty people, I got so, so much closer to only four members. And if my trust issues were nothing yet, surprisingly one of those stopped talking to me without prior notice —and started talking shit about me, I still don't even know the reasons behind this—, the second started to give up with us to pursue women desperately in a very creepy way —even treated me as a fool for not taking chances—, the third caught up with hard drugs —he tried to convince me to succumb cocaine— and the fourth disappeared from everything —although he came back time after. He just departured at bad moment—.

At that time (2020), the group was in process of disbanding, and I left it with six people who wasn't so close as the four I mentioned, but they were nice people, very good people. A group that was stable and had no beef.

I met my last girlfriend, a sweet girl I saw coincidentally in one of those Instagram's stories from one member of our old group. She caught my attention with such tenderness I couldn't let this opportunity pass. We met each other, and started —yeah, instantly— a relationship. Then COVID appeared and you know, blah, blah, quarantine, blah, blah. We finally started dating weekly when the restrictions ended, and we caught up in a very sweet relationship I still remember emotional.

Of course, those trust issues appeared, those I thought dead for a while. And I screwed up by taking the very wrong decisions from this.

With my six pals - I screwed up because of my anger issues. With the cheating I had from my first girlfriend and those four best friends going crazy, I started developing less patience and less self-control with everyone, so I started to intimidate others thinking that this could prevent them from leaving me —dumb move—.

With my girlfriend - I screwed up with my innumerable insecurities saying insinuating things to a female friend thinking 'if she cheats on me like my ex-gf, at least I won't be so mentally screwed this time because I did it first' —asshole move—. 

Now I've got nothing. I started giving up and thinking that this is all well-deserved. I ruined very strong friendships and I ruined the relationship I've had with someone that turned out was trustful as no one else.

I'm full of guilty, with nothing, nothing to rescue from me, nothing of value in me. I can't even feel comfortable looking at the mirror and seeing a person who just caused every single goddamn thing he suffered in his childhood to people that loved him the most. I tried to seek forgiveness in them, but they won't accept me one more time. And I'm now again at the same place where all started, and I'm scared.

I called for an emergency mental health appointment, but mental health is taken as a joke in Spain and they don't take it too seriously. If we don't talk about pills for depression and a dumb 'therapy' psychiatrists do, and want to have proper treatment with psychologists, they said it'd be no sooner than mid-2023...

I wanted to kill myself as a teen because I wanted to stop hearing all of those laughs and no support from my classmates and my parents. That was unjustified.

Now it's simple as 'because I deserve it'. This sounds more justified.

I don't feel deserving of nothing, but deep down I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, I'm trying to remember anything good in me, but I'm not capable of it. I can't. 

I'm planning on taking pills and have an overdose at exactly 00:00 of the 31st. I feel like I'm just giving life a chance to get better, I don't know.

Thanks for reading this, and thanks for helping me since I was fifteen, Reddit.

TL;DR I had a very traumatic past, and caused many insecurities that I ended screwing everything I was enjoying nowadays with my friends and gf. Now it's hard to seek any good for/in me."

No bank allows me to pull student loans on my own, and nobody I know can/will be my cosigner for those loans.

I don’t have any real friends, people I chat with sometimes but nobody seems to stick around or care deeply for me, never enough to be considered consistent supports in my life. I was badly abused in my last two relationships, I got stabbed in one, which made me develop a host of mental illnesses, but made me realize bleeding out doesn’t hurt.

I made a list of reasons to die, it was three pages… the reasons why not were only for points. My bags are so heavy and after all my mistakes, how I feel like I’m always being karmatically punished, that when I reach out for help, I still feel like I deserve to die. I’ve been in and out of mental health facilities since I was 11, tried every medication known to man, called hotlines, been in almost every kind of therapy and now that I may never see the only person I love and live for again, I feel like me ruining their life warrants me ending mine. I asked friends to tell me what they’d remember about me when I’m gone, they said some nice things, but all I can think of is how they haven’t been around for years and they’ll probably be the people who will say they knew me well and “never saw it coming” and cry over social media for attention.

I have met some people who have had such a positive impact on my life, such as my bf, but also some people who have destroyed me.
2 years ago, i posted a post to reddit talking about my plan to end my life on r/suicidewatch. I was 16 years old. A man responded to me privately and offered to be support and to be my friend. This man was from Palestine and was 26 at the time. He was so nice to me and he introduced me to other people my age who he had also met online. I learned to love this man and I truly believed he was my friend. I called him my brother and I spent so much time talking to him.
He wasn't a friend tho. I was too naive to see what was going on. This man started to tell me about himself, he said his job was to help people, in the military. He introduced me to a younger boy, who was 14 at the time, I became friends with this boy. I'll call him A. This man guilt tripped and lied so many times. Caused so much stress and anxiety to everyone he spoke to. He made himself sound like a Saint, but he was lying about everything. He lied about so many things. And I feel stupid to admit that I believed him and that I fell in love with him. Not in a romantic way, but in a strange familial way. He would pretend that he shot himself in the leg or that he had kidney failure or that he had shot himself in the head. He would lie about everything.
Eventually, it became more and more concerning. This man started to talk to me about sex. I opened up to him about my history of csa. And I told him my story. He started to talk more about sexual things and would encourage me to touch myself and send him pictures of me in my bra so he could ""see my body type and help me to work out"". And I hate to admit that I fell for it. He would also send pornographic images and videos and ask me to masturbate. And although I was uncomfortable, he would make me feel so guilty if I said no.
Eventually I couldn't handle it anymore so I attempted to kill myself, and I got really fucking close.
This man contacted the hospital I was staying at and got them to let me home without the psych ward. So I was sent home and had to have a nurse watching me sleep at home in my room until I became more stable.
My mother read through my phone and found everything on it. It ended with me not being allowed online for 2 months, and me being in and out of hospital for that time. Eventually I got my phone back and started speaking 5o him again. But he was scared. And he threatened me. He asked for more explicit pictures. He contacted my sister and told her she was the reason I would kill myself. That's what lead me to finally cut this man out of my life. He also threatened to harm my mother and my family. After almost 2 years of speaking to him. I blocked him, and stopped talking to him. I thought that was it and we were done. But I was so wrong.
He started by sending flowers in the shape of my name to my house with a note. He messaged me constantly on every platform asking for my forgiveness and begging me to come back to him. He called me from different numbers. He pretended to be different people to talk to me. He contacted my friends pretending to be someone else. He made a reddit account using my real name and posted to r/rape with my real story and asked to talk to people on that subreddit. He even sent a nude picture of me to one of my friends as an attempt to blackmail me.
Once I turned 18, he stopped trying to contact me.
It's been a long road, and he is gone from my life now. But honestly, it's been the most stressful experience. And it bothers me every single day. I can't talk to anyone about it, so I'm venting here.
Not everyone you speak to is who they say they are and you should never do anything you're uncomfortable with.
I've struggled with so many things on top of this these past few years too. I've lost 8 people who were close to me. I've had to meet with the man who sexually abused me throughout my childhood. I'm autistic and have been struggling with communication and fucking up in my relationship, which means so much to me.
I don't know what the point of this post was, I just needed to get this out. I am at the end of my rope, and I don't know how much longer I can stay like this. I just needed to vent, I don't think I'll be here for much longer.

I feel like shit because the people who say they'll support me are taking on too much of a shit show because I want to be able to talk to them almost everyday and be able to vent, but I shouldn't need those people and they have lives to live, and can't be there for me 24/7. So I end up thinking that it would be better for everyone if I just died. And I can't be honest to them because admitting that you need someone that much is horrifying. And it's not fair to them. The only thing stopping me from offing myself is my self harm. I've been battling that shit for half a year and I'm feeling really strong urges to hurt myself right now, just so I can feel justified to go to people for help.

I'm planning on getting out of here. I have my good bye notes written, and I have my plan in mind. I'm not going to say what method I'm using because I don't want anyone else mimicking me. 

Once I purchase the equipment needed it will only takes seconds so I'm not afraid of pain. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and I just want a play to document my thoughts. 

Before anyone tries to stop me, I want to tell you it's okay. I've heard it all before, life gets better, things won't seem so bad in a few months, when you're about to end it all you realize how easily everything will be fixed. I don't want to hear it. I appreciate the concern, but things don't feel better. I've spent months trying to fix myself, to feel better, but I'm tired. 

When I was a kid I spent a lot of time being abused. My parents left me and my siblings for 10 years. I was beaten and constantly told by my siblings that I wasn't special, that I was borderline retarded. I had no confidence and no support. 

I eventually met a girl who gave me a taste at being a person, she guided me to become a man. I wanted to marry her. We had our ups and, as all things had to be, we had our downs. She left me before I even knew, and when I finally found out why i was broken. We were together for 5 years before when i found out she had been cheating on me for 6 months.

I didn't know what to do with myself, until I met Her. She was everything I could've wanted in a partner, but I wasn't for her. I had issues and she accepted them for a time. But eventually all good things would come to an end. I wasn't getting better, and she couldn't wait anymore. She couldn't do it anymore. She told me good bye in November of last year and she never looked back. 

I spent months in anguish. Once again I found someone I was prepared to marry, and once again I was broken. Dozens of nights crying alone, dozens wondering what i couldve done better, and yet more spent trying to become the kind of man that she would've wanted. 

I met hundreds of women in this time, rebounding from one to another for months. I even snagged a girlfriend for a few months. But she left me worse than I started. She showed me that trusting someone isn't the same as being trusted. She broke down everything she hated about me with no regrets and showed me how foolish I was for wanting to love again.

In the weeks that followed I've continued to talk to friends and reflect on myself, but the final straw was something I stumbled onto by accident. I found out that I still had my ex's Facebook account info saved and saw all the messages explaining why I was an awful person to be with. I don't know what I expected reading through them but they were all true. It was devastating but at the same uplifting. It's given me the fuel I needed to get this show on the road. 

And that's where it ends. My story isn't going to win any Oscar's or anything but that's it. If anything to many of you this will sound stupid, but please humor me. These are basically my last words.

Thank you to whoever was able to make it this far. If things go well I'll be out of here. I wish you all the best, and I hope that you are able to all find your own solutions. See ya guys :)"

I was doing everything in my power to assess the situation and look at it with an open mind, but I guess the thoughts weren’t mutual, and she probably was just digging for a reason to get rid of me. That same day we broke things off because “I’m sad all the time”, and I still think about that day daily. I could go on and on about things that make my life miserable, but I guess I’ll end it here. 

I guess I did end up blurting a small portion of my life story. 

I apologize for wasting your time

I need to get in state ID which will take like a month, then luckily right up the road is a place to get a decent 9mm for under $300 so between saving up, and getting all the paperwork in order it should be about 6 weeks. I might face some issues due to previously being baker acted but hopefully that won’t matter.

Just going to either sit in my rv get drunk and blow my brains out or maybe go to a pier or something at the edge of the ocean where no one’s around and do it there. I think it’d be nicer but the idea of sand getting into a hole in my head and into my brain is scary.

I’m thinking of what the best way to do this is exactly but I know this is my only way. My current residence is about 103F during the day when I get home and will only cool down to 89F until about 8pm so staying here isn’t viable long term.

Outside of that because I’ve been ostracized to this cramped little space and exiled from the being indoors I’ve got jack shit in the way of a support system, but I’ve been feeling myself draining for years now.

All my family a generation above me fucked up their lives enough to need to live off their parents. And my grandparents are now stretched to thin to do anything for me. Only one of them really let me down though.

But where was I, I’m rambling. Doesn’t matter. This is mostly just for me anyways. Good luck future Chris. I hope you get to leave this shit behind."

1542,POCD and the Crippling Fear That Any One of the Folks I Sexted Online Could've Been a Minor,w2jyd5,NotAVeryGoodSandwich,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2jyd5/pocd_and_the_crippling_fear_that_any_one_of_the/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"This may sound really stupid, but I figured I'd put it out there and see if anyone has anything to say on it.

So I'm a 23yo trans woman, I've been really sexually confused and sometimes sexually frustrated, and I've been active on a hookup app called Pure, in addition to using Omegle a total of 3 times for sexual purposes.

No matter what I do, I can't seem to escape the fear that any one of the people I spoke to on these apps was a minor disguising themselves as an adult. On Pure I always start by asking for the person's age and name, and usually I will also ask for a live photo to see if everything checks out. I try to have a short conversation and make absolutely certain that the person isn't a minor. However, this is when things get dicey to me. You can never know who someone is online. You can never be absolutely certain that someone is the age that they say they are. I always took comfort in the idea that the app is clearly labeled as 18+ and minors are forbidden from using it, but if there's one thing I know from being a kid it's that kids do not give a shit about rules. In one instance I actually did ask for someone's age and they said 17, at which point I told them no and reported them. But the vast majority of the time, these folks claim to be of legal age and their pictures seem to confirm this. I always knew there was a possibility for minors to abuse these services, yet I continued to use the service. I never spoke to anyone whom I suspected to be a minor, and if anyone was sketchy about disclosing their age or immediately said ""18"" then I ended the conversation because that's also just a fine line I don't care for. Not interested in talking to 18 year olds as an adult in my mid-20s. But I had pretty graphic sexual conversations with these people and sometimes shared nudes with them, and I never initiated a discussion that they didn't begin with. I started every conversation slowly and checked for 100% confirmation that they wanted to sext. Same thing with Omegle. I only had one graphic sexual conversation there, in addition to one conversation on a subreddit, and I am plagued by the paranoia that at any point one of those men or women could have been lying about their age. When it came to video chat I went into the unmoderated adult-only section, but I understand that this still doesn't guarantee there isn't a child on the other end pretending to be an adult. When I used the video chat I hid myself and just showed my torso/face or a blanket, never flashing my genitalia to any stranger right off the bat. Most of the time I honestly just watched men getting off, which I realize is also not a good behavior and it enables men to use these sites irresponsibly when they obviously shouldn't. What led me to stop using Omegle after 2 days was actually something I saw in the unmoderated video chat. There's a lot of fucked up shit on there, and I don't think I have any business going anywhere near it or touching that shitty and god awful website with a 100 foot pole. I saw what I am almost 100% certain was a naked child and I immediately regretted using the site for any kind of sexual purpose. Never again. And never again will I use sexting apps, hookup apps, or have any kind of sexual conversation online. Never. We are DONE. It feels like posing a legitimate danger to children; the US government and FBI are already targeting sites like Omegle for exposing children to sexual predators, but that's not even mentioning the fact that it exposew children to NORMAL people, and the children lie to those people to get a quick sexual release or some kind of teenage power trip. I knew a person who knowingly had sex with multiple late 20's men when they were 17, and I've read plenty of stories about kids and teens pretending to be adults for some twisted purpose or another.

Have I endangered the safety of a child or a minor? Am I engaging in behavior that endangers minors? Have I been a risk or a danger to a minor at any point? Does understanding that minors have unmonitored access to the entire internet mean that I knowingly put minors at risk? And how can I ever live with myself knowing that as long as I didn't see an ID or have live photos and videos of the person, they could've been someone completely different? I spoke to someone named Mattingly who acted incredibly weird at all times, and I have wondered numerous times if Mattingly could've been a minor just messing with adults on hookup apps. 

Is there any way that I can live with the guilt and the chronic fear?? Part of coping with OCD fears is often just accepting that they could be real and sitting with that fear, not dismissing them. I am debilitating worried that what I've done genuinely opens up the possibility that I sexted with a minor, not just an OCD fear possibility, but a real practical possibility. A person with OCD may have a fear of someone they love getting hurt if they don't do a certain compulsion or ritual, for example. And they will be told to sit with the idea that something might happen to their loved ones, but to just accept it and sit with it. I don't know if I can continue to live sitting with the idea that I sexted with a minor. If I actually had done that, and authorities found out, I would be looking at prison or probation for endangering the safety of a child. And what's interesting is I see a LOT OF PEOPLE online writing about the fear that they may be locked up and charged for sexting with a minor, but few people - if any - are struggling to live with the guilt and the immense personal shame of having jeopardized the safety of a minor and having LEGITIMATELY NO POSSIBLE WAY TO EVER KNOW or find out if the person they spoke to was a minor. If I meet someone in person and I can make sure they're 18+, that's awesome and normal. If there is ever any doubt, I AS AN ADULT should be asking for their ID or some other definitive proof beyond a reasonable doubt that they are an adult. When it comes to online sexting, there is no proof anywhere. There is legitimately no possible way to prove it, and these services do not require people to submit identification. Even if they did require it, they could just scan their parents' ID to bypass it. There is never any way to know. It's crippling. It's driving me absolutely insane. And I know what you're thinking; there are countless, and I mean COUNTLESS women and men who use Omegle frequently and repeatedly open themselves up to these possibilities, but they don't feel even a tiny bit of remorse or self-awareness. They just whip their dick or pussy or boobs out at whoever they find attractive and start masturbating in front of them and telling them to get undressed. That thought doesn't help at all because the issue here is that I fear I have hurt a child or children, not that I want to know if I'm a good or bad person. I am not concerned with what I am or ""am I a creep?"" or some shit like that. I am scared for the safety of a child.

My closest example here is how I work at a gas station right now, and there is a policy of immediate termination if you sell alcohol to a minor, even if you can physically see them in person and they produce an ID right in front of you to prove it. On Omegle? On Pure? No such thing.

Please help. It's not really that I want to die, it's that I feel like if this is true or it could possibly be true, and I could have scarred a child for the rest of their life, then I have no business being alive."
1543,Pros / Cons,w2f8w1,Jane123987,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w2f8w1/pros_cons/,2,SuicideWatch,False,"Hi Everybody,

I want to start by saying thank you for reading this. And, if you are experiencing this pain too, my heart breaks for you.

This is my situation. I am a 27 year old woman. For the last few years I have been in a horrific PTSD cycle. While it was difficult for the first year, I had a lot more resources and avenues not explored, so, while I was still very depressed, I still retained a ""something out there"" mentality.

In that ""out there"" pursuit I have been to the best trauma centers in America, and, for that I am extremely grateful. I had great success there, however I could not maintain operating within my personal window of tolerance once I left. Basically, I have not been able to achieve appropriate energy expenditure levels, as what is required for my existence is more than I physically have to give.

I am really scared because reality is sinking in and I am getting cornered fast. My basic functioning is in steep decline. My hygiene is horrendous. I have to consciously prop myself up in public from fainting from dissociation. I started to hit myself and slap myself in the face. My sleep is very poor.

I have watched myself become a shell of myself. I wither away by the day.

I am extremely conscientious and am aware of the ripple effects of the trauma taking my own life will have. It is because of this I am extremely vocal to my loved ones where I am at. I will never just do it and blindsight them. I want to be responsible with this.

I truly, in my heart of hearts, do not see me getting better. I want to do right. But I am facing this dilema-

Do I get out in front of this and plan an assisted suicide that is safe and dignified and seal my fate, or, do I keep hanging on and risk getting into such a deteriorated state that I no longer have the luxury of a clear headed end, and meet my end in a messy way?

This is what is on my mind, and this is my question to myself and to the world.

I feel I must treat this with the reverence that comes along with a terminal illness."

Destroyed opportunities and purposely isolated myself as to not burden anyone. Talked to my guidance counsilor and tried scheduling a psych check up but didnt get to. Counsilor said that a guardian or a parent needs to be present even if you're already at the age of 18. Both parents work abroad and I'm the only ""adult"" in the house. Relatives only visit ocassionally to help with things that needs guardianship. Too scared to talk to a therapist with guardians present especially with parents around since I think they're the main source of every stress and shit I'm feeling right now.

Used to feel anxious, used to feel sad/depressed every single day, used to be crushed by pressure every time i think. I cant even manage to cry anymore.

I used to imagine myself disappearing and moving to a completely rural area, and giving people time to forget me before I finally ended it to reduce impact as much as possible, but I do not have the patience to gather the money for that. I know that I will snap soon. And I know that in death, I won't receive any of the respect towards my identity, name, or life, for that matter.

My husband ignores me most of the time, except when he wants to talk at me, or yell at me about something I supposedly did ""wrong"" 

My kids are both disabled and will need lifelong care. I couldn't even give birth properly because I got so sick during pregnancy and almost died.

I've run my own business for the past 20 years making and selling quilts. I've won a ton of awards for my work.

I don't understand why people would be so hateful towards a complete stranger.

I have no friends, just acquaintances that invite me to things to get a free quilt. I know it's true because I was at a baby shower and the mom told me that she only invited me for a free quilt. Everyone turned and looked angry at me, like I had broken some kind of rule.

when I was 11-14 I was severely bullied by kids at my school, in intermediate I was beaten by boys twice my size,slut shamed everyday for wearing a crop top to school on mufti day,none of the other girls wanted to be my friend because I came out as bisexual and they said that they didn’t want me to “rape them”.I spent almost every day in a storage room in my classroom building on my laptop chatting on suicide helpline chat servers, hiding from the people that would do that shit to me. I started cutting about 3 months after the bullying started and I haven’t stopped 6 years later. when I first went to high school I pretended to be tough and would threaten people and really hang out with the wrong crowd, and honestly they bullied the shit out of me. They were all older than me and continuously kicked me in my shins, body shamed me (Im very short and underweight) but they would protect me if anyone else tried to be mean to me, eventually after being in a relationship with one of them that forced me to smoke drugs at 14, I got psychosis, I broke up with him and no longer had the protection of the group. I started working on myself and eventually I got diagnosed with autism by the mental health services I had been with for my anxiety and adhd since I was 6, I didn’t really tell anyone for a while because I was scared to be thought of as different. I met my best friend that year, it’s our two year anniversary today actually. Skipping foward I was hanging out with some really awesome people who respected me and liked me for who I was, without the bullshit tryhard bully act I had put on in the past. anyway one day I had drunk an entire bottle of brandy at my grandmother’s house and had a complete breakdown, I don’t remember anything but vomiting back at my own house and then waking up to an ambulance crew taking me to the emergency room, I wasn’t medically unstable so they just gave me a crisis assessment, they wanted to send me to the psych ward but there were not beds so they sent me home. Around 9 months worth of being 15 I was drinking alone everyday but eventually I stopped. 
in around December 2020 I was diagnosed with anorexia, but I was not treated for it because my public eating disorder service wouldn’t take me because I was autistic.
The month after I turned 16 I attempted suicide. I found the keys to the safe that held all the medications, but I was caught trying to get into the medications by my mum and then her and my dad chased me around the house for ages as I tried to grab chemicals to drink, eventually I gave up after being tackled by my dad in the middle of the road for trying to run in front of cars. The next day I had my very first psych ward admission.
Fast foward
I had been in and out of the psych ward around 10 times since august 2021 
in November I started dating my boyfriend who we will call Jake, I was very in love with Jake, but I was also constantly on my guard because I have really bad trust issues, in December I was ambushed with an admission to the eating disorders unit without any warning because my anorexia had gotten so bad, I was put under the mental health act and was there for about ten weeks.
Jake left me about 2 days into being there but then he said it was just a break, 6 weeks after he said we were on a break I broke up with him because I was tired of waiting. but we still talked, after 10 weeks of being in the unit I was kicked out in the evening for not eating and refusing treatment, I then ran away to a far away town in a manic episode, I had sex with a random guy who didn’t treat me very nicely, I don’t remember any of it.
Then I went to a internet friends house and we drunk a bottle of peach vodka, next thing I remember I was being carried over a fence by a random guy and placed near a bush on the side of the road while he proceeded to have sex with my friend (who was 15) I don’t remember him raping me but I do remember the hangover, my parents had been looking for me with the police all night and I never responded to them, and then I finally told them where I was.
Eventually after being home me and Jake got back together and he said it was my fault for what happened and that I did it to hurt him and that it was cheating. Then in around April I got a text saying that he had been talking in his class about how he was cheating on me with so many girls and he was using me for sex. I broke up with him and he told me it was all in my head and none of it was real, so I got back with him. He continued to cheat on me until I finally got even more messages and proof of him cheating on me. before and after the rape, we broke up and got back together about 20 times after that. then one night a couple weeks ago he got me high and then kept touching me after I had expressed that I didn’t want to have sex, I told him no every time he touched me until he started touching my crotch, at that moment I lost all amount of love and hope for him and our relationship. I left him a few days ago now and I feel free. But I still feel so suicidal. 2 years of this shit.
10 months of him.
it’s my 17th birthday tomorrow, I hope I’ll make it."

I had a mental breakdown and I just wanted to end it. Now I’m having regrets and feel like crap. I’ve tried searching up information about overdosing on this drug but I seriously can’t find much on google about it. 

I did find a PowerPoint from a med school lesson and it had a slide that said overdose symptoms start at 19 mg/kg of body weight. I’m short and thin and I calculated it to be a tiny bit over 19. I’m scared of dying now. I also couldn’t find much about overdosing on lamotrigine on the bipolar subs and are extremely unhelpful because they don’t want to approve my posts.

She said, “all this medication and therapy is doing nothing for you”. It has helped me but not in the way you think it does. I’m sorry I’m not as ambitious as my cousin, I give up. Having two kids is stressful I know especially when your partner lives in a different state.

They’ve fallen on hard times & just haven’t been able to get out of the rut. My father is severe bipolar adhd and it’s hard for people to be around him. I have an older brother & sister but they don’t really care for them and it’s pretty much always on me to help them out. They have no one else. Neither of my grandparents want to help them. No support from aunt’s or uncles. It’s all on me. So i’ve been dealing with this for a while and this last week it’s pretty much hit rock bottom. My parents show up to my house with a U-Haul last Monday. They’ve been evicted from their house in a shitty little town about an hour a way. So we move all of their stuff into a shed I have out back. I live in a 3 bedroom house with my girlfriend and our 2 roommates. I can’t let them stay with me because of obvious reasons/issues with roommates. They’ve been on my couch ever since with no real obtainable plan to fix the situation. Their truck broke down 2 days after they showed up and me and my dad have been trying to fix it. It’s not looking good. My parents have 2 chihuahuas and they cause a lot of stress with my roommate situation so today I called off work & i’ve been trying to get a plan started. Nothing seemed to arise - we drove around to their old friends houses today but no one showed. We’ve been sitting in my garage while my roommates have company inside. I’m ready to give up.

An only child, she had a big room with so many cute toys, but she never let me near them. Instead, she tormented me for no reason. She didn't like me, a little girl, she only liked my little boy cousin for some odd reason.

My sister is 7 years older than me, and always got along with them. She's my only sibling. All the time when I was young, she didn't play with me a whole lot, and never wanted me to hang out with the three of them. Sometimes, I wonder what I did to deserve this. I'm a loner at school.

Im 33f. I'm transferring jobs next month. I've been here for 2 years, and it's been 2 years of hell.  One coworker who is in a position of power has bullied and harassed me so a point that I began self harming after years of being clean from it, as well as 2 suicide attempts. The thing is, only 1 person has ever spoken up for me. But they left because of this coworker.  5 people have left in the 2 years I have been here because of her.  I have crippling shyness, and I literally don't know how to take up for myself. I've always just wanted someone to just help me by telling her 'That's enough'. I've run to the bathroom crying countless times, and she always is ridiculously happy when i come back after calming down.  She knows what she does.  Nothing will happen to her, no punishments. 
 I reported her once for one time, and this is on her file.

So basically, on the last day, after I change my phone number, I want to report her to hr and how badly she treated me.  I'll also have moved 2 hours away. I don't have social media, so I can't be found.  

It's like she gets a high from yelling at me in front of customers. It's not that I'm bad at work, every review I get is 'exceeds expectations', and it is just me.

I just hate her so much.  Forgiveness will come  in a few years, but I like anyone who treats a coworker like this needs to be reported.  

Is there any tips or thoughts on this situation?  Has anyone been through this.

She's over 50 and has kids and the amount of petty behavior she does is unbelievable.  

I have barely any self esteem and I can definitely say that I don't deserve this treatment.

I worry about my daughter because me dying would probably mess her up, and that thought should be enough but I'm such a piece of crap that knowing that I still want to die.....

I was supposed to start college many times now, but usually my pains act up.  Right now it’s my hamstring, I am supposed to do orientation next week, but if I have limited mobility, my school won’t accept me for that semester.  If I have to cancel one more time, I honestly will drive to a mountainside or a high bridge and just let go.  Let go of all my failures as a human, as a son, all of it.  All my friends have thrived in their lives and I’m in a constant black hole of 4 years now.  I cannot tear away from it no matter what.  I’m just useless, living off my mom and her husband, he hates me (which I understand) my mom resents me.  My biological dad has always been a piece of shit who never cared about me.

My life is just one big fuck up. At this point I have completely given up, I don’t think things at all will get better. It’s always one step forward, 20 steps back. When one thing goes good in life, something else ends up going wrong that puts me way back, undoing any fucking progress. My parents think I’m a huge failure and disappointment. Honestly I don’t blame them. I’m a absolutely horrible individual, I do nothing but cause people stress and pain. I have a brother who’s mental health is terrible as well and everyday there’s new drama with him, I can’t fucking take it. It takes such a mental toll on me. I am both physically and emotionally exhausted. I could try to improve my life but what’s the point? Whenever I try to improve my life all progress ends up being undone by something bad. I think that’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned in these 23 years that I’ve been alive, that it will always be 1 step forward and then a million steps back. Sometimes I believe I’ve been cursed. I wish I could be locked up in a mental asylum and have a lobotomy because I’m just batshit crazy. 

I recently lied to a bunch of people and they all found out. It’s bad, it was about something serious. I truly do not deserve at all to have anything good happen. I am a horrible individual that should burn in hell. I’m sure word is going to get out about what I’ve done in my city and everyone else will see me as the fuck up that I am. My parents said they forgive me and it’s not as bad as I think, that I’m overreacting. I’m not overreacting. I am a unhinged person, I should be put in one of those padded cells. I truly hope for the worst for myself. If I manage to keep living, I hope my life is filled with pain and heartache. 

I think it would just be easier on everyone if I died. Then my parents can focus all their attention on my brother and I won’t continue to be this huge embarrassment to them. Sure, they’ll probably be sad if I died but if I died, I won’t continue to fuck shit up for them and everyone around me. They won’t have to shell out money on me for therapy or pay for my psych meds. They won’t be ashamed of me anymore. I feel so bad for my family that they have to deal with me. God I’ve been alive 23 years and have nothing to show for it. I’m pretty sure my name and picture is in the dictionary for the definition for failure. I’m honestly kind of impressed that I’ve managed to screw so many things up. It’s like I’m perpetually stuck at rock bottom. Every time I try to crawl my way out of this pit of hell, I fall right back down. 

At this point in my life, I just don’t expect good things to happen. I’m not surprised at all when things get messed up. Why even bother getting my hopes up about anything? I even texted my therapist and told her what happened and how I was feeling and she didn’t even bother to say anything. Hell I wouldn’t be surprised if she cancelled my appointment for tomorrow. 

Even in love I don’t bother getting my hopes up with guys. I know they will eventually nope out and hey, I don’t blame them. I mean I’m fat, jobless, don’t drive and still live with my parents. I sound like such a catch don’t I lol? I’m the type of girl you fuck and then throwaway, I’m just a placeholder for when something better comes along. I guess I’ve just got to learn to be ok with that, judging by the way my life has gone, I can’t really change that. I could lose weight, get a job, move out and start driving but that won’t change much. I’m just not an impressive person. I’m unremarkable, a stick figure is more remarkable than me. 

As far as friends go, I have none. That isn’t surprising though, why would someone want to be friends with someone as fucked up as me? Holy crap I am a piece of work. I shouldn’t even try to make friends with people for their own sake. Plus people feel nothing but pity for me. I try to never get close to anyone because what’s the point? There’s nothing anyone can do to improve my life or make me happier, my life is super pathetic. 

As far as how I want to die, I’m not going to put that here. I don’t think I’ll kill myself today or tomorrow, it’s going to take years to plan my death. I’m going to have to save up money to cover the costs of my funeral. I don’t know if I want a marked grave or to be cremated, I think I should just be buried in a unmarked grave somewhere no one will find me. I don’t think I’ll receive any visitors to my grave anyways, I didn’t touch a lot of lives. I think I’ll be completely forgotten about when I die, in a few decades hardly anyone will remember me. It’ll be like I never even existed. I think when I die, I will either pretend to go camping and do it deep in a forest or drive out to the middle of nowhere. Hopefully, my body will be really hard to find or not found at all. I hope I’m not found at all. I want it to be like I just disappeared, vanished without a trace."

By many standards, I should be happy. I have a wife and three kids, we’ve been married for almost 9 years, dated since we were 17 (we’re 33 now). I work in my dream career which i can work from home, we have a roof over our heads in one of the most expensive places to live in USA. Food on the table etc. I shouldn’t have much to complain about. 

The thing about this career is I’m at the beginning. This requires that I work. A LOT. I work day and night, sacrificing sleep, often meals, but most of all, quality time with my family. I have to continue working because I need to meet deadlines, and I’m paid according to those deadlines (she doesn’t work, just me). 

For the last year I’ve seen my wife enjoy life and be so happy. She goes out with friends often, or they come by the house to spend time with her + the kids. While I work. I know all of these people, but I don’t consider them my friends; I’m just sort of by proxy. But she doesn’t understand this. 

Back in October I got in my head and realized I don’t have any desire to live. I wasn’t part of anything, my purpose was to earn money for my wife and kids. I couldn’t bring myself to try and end my life but I didn’t want to be alive. Those feelings are coming back. 

I cannot afford to just take time off, but even if I could, I have almost no friends I could reach out to or that would reach out to me (there’s one, but he moved to the other side of the globe - he’s been my friend since we were very little).  

Every time there’s a gathering, I feel more and more distant from my wife usually because I for one reason or another, cannot be a part of it. I’m feeling again like I’m useless other than a cash cow, and that they’d be fine if I disappeared. After all, she has this huge group of friends (ironically, most of them through me) who could replace me in an instant. 

Maybe I’m being ridiculous. But I don’t feel like living anymore."

This is not just a complaint letter of petty, but the only resource left to make sense out of misery, and the only way to create resolve.

I suspect that this has been going on since the start, although before I had a stronger will.

I have no interest in anything, but the underlying reason is that I do not think I am capable or useful for accomplishing things in life, my will and strength are gone, and my vitality and desire to keep on with life are rapidly vanishing. 

My biggest concern is that my actions are not just affecting me, but also the people around me, in the sense that I have nothing to contribute as an 18-year-old adult. I do not study, I don't have a job. I try to function,  but sometimes waking up is hard even if I have been in bed for 12 hours.

I have ruined my reputation in an academic sense, the thing that burdens me is that I have let down everyone who thought I could get through, I can interpret that I have a weak ego, and I can't deal with the constant humiliation from family because I have made the same mistakes repeatedly.

I am afraid of the psychological punishment and guilt, for obvious reasons because I’m not financially investing in my education, and I don’t have a good excuse for failing.

I can't blame anxiety or depression, but the real problem is me. I lack determination and objectives, although I do have aspirations. I have failed myself so often that others do not believe in me, and neither do I.

My tale is probably ending here when I have critical decisions to plan carefully and strategically, my concern is to know what can be the cleanest possible way to die. Rat poison is too messy, as I would probably bleed too much. If I cut my wrists or disembowel myself it is also incredibly messy. I don’t want people to have access to my body, so I’d have to go out."

Hi im just another 19 years old. 2022 is one of the roughest year in my life, graduating into university, I was so excited like a child, I was so excited to meet all this new people in a new school in a new city. I was so motivated to make the best project I could ever make. I looked forward in what kind of friendship I will get that I will never forget once I leave this city. 
Guess what, I’m such a socially awkward cunt that makes everyone awkward whenever I try to speak. other than being able to introduce myself and ask people about their hobbies and stuff, I can never turn these friendship into something more, I guess it’s because English is not my main language but whatever. I have such a crazy imaginative world inside my head that the lecturers liked me at the first two weeks, now they just try their best to not let me express unless it’s presentation. 
Everyone seems to avoid me in this new environment, my 3 only friends(flat mates) would never actually come to my room and hang out, I seemed like an annoying fuck hanging around their rooms where they’re just trying to be nice and not complain about it. My besties are all over the world chasing their dreams like I do and as time flies, we rarely contact each other anymore. ‘Friends’ always said I’m such a nice person, a funny one too but they would never dig deeper into me. No one really understood me even if I showed them my true self and my dark sides. People come to me with all kinds of problems, mostly mental health issues and I always showed that I care about them and would sit there listen for the whole night even I wanted to sleep, but no one was ever there listen to my depression for even just an hour. It seems like my grandma is the only one who truly cares about me. My mother just wanted me to success in life and never cared about what I’m up to right now. My dad killed himself so early in my life he is just like a stranger me. 
I’m surrounded by people but yet I feel so fucking lonely. I thought I have a good ideology about the world and wanted to share it but no one cares about my perspective, or just went on shitting on my face. I thought I had my own views of philosophy about life but people just thinks it’s trash and that I’m being unrealistic, useless daydreamer and a tumor of society.

Im stuck in a loop from depression to normal to depression to normal, I feel like it killed something inside me but I never know what is it. Perhaps my dream, I have no intention to pursue my dream as an Architect anymore and I’m still hold on because of people’s expectations.. classmate telling me don’t give up!! Well fuck you, where was you all when I feel left out in the group, when I said something and no one wanted to reply? Where was you all when I nearly broke down while still giving out energy to all you hypocritical cunts? 

Into the 7th months of my new life in a new city, i never expected I’d be longing for death again as a kill switch to all this bullshit. I never thought I would want to use this as an escape again ever since the last time I think to kill myself. I thought I’d be better if I stop hanging around people that doesn’t care about me, but it ended in my feet deeper into in the mud. I feel so powerless, my family would still be fine living off from my mothers business and my brothers medical profession, I’m just a parasite sucking off my family’s blood. I feel like a stranger to myself ever since I finished high school, the popular outgoing funny and respected me was long gone. To the point that my mind seems to lock myself up to protect me, I feel so confused about everything going on inside me, stronger than any depression episodes as if I had an ego death, I feel so numb.. I just want to end this misery but I’m so fucking privileged, I had the resource to fly out of home to study, I had the freedom to live without my parent and I shouldn’t be depressed and I’m just an ungrateful little shit, some people had depression for 30 years and they are still holding on, people had no parents at all and a much worse life story than me why should I be depressed or I’m just not qualified to be depressed. This is killing me.. I just can’t stop laughing at how pity I’m right now, numbing myself with weed and lsd and cigarettes. Funny eh"

Selling numbers have gone to amounts of which I could have never imagined and nothing seems to be changing anytime soon.

Backstory:
I couldn't stay at my parents. Ive been abused for years and all I wanted was a home


So moved to my boyfriends parents house. We've been living in a very small room. I've been looking for a place of my/our own for 1,5 years now with 0 luck so far. I've worked my ass off to get the income I feel I am happy with. But the fact that we can't afford to rent/buy a home; Makes me depressed and feel like I'm not earning enough. (WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, I WORK FULL TIME)

Now, what's the point... we can't get a home, not even a small apartment. The prices are ridiculously high and I've been getting so hopeless, because trying to do ur best is so exhausting especially when u dont have ur own space to wind down at, at the end of a day. I feel like a slave working all day and then going back to a small prison cell after work. I don't eat well, because the refrigerator is downstairs and after a long week as the introvert I am...going downstairs and seeing people gives me ALOT of anxiety. There are no gyms, no activities here to participate in and going outside only results in me spending a bunch of money. I JUST WANT SOME SPACE - A HOME, where I always feel comfortable. My own little garden/balcony to take care of my plants. My/our own bathroom, where I can put my products - instead of having theM in a little drawer in the closet.

So in my free time I tend to numb myself by playing games I don't like or either crying in bed.

I've seen tons of news flashes about people committing suicide bc theyre hopeless for the upcoming future. I'm so hopeless too!  but I can't bring myself to do it, because its not fair and I can't rest with the thought of being held down like this. I don't want to be a victim of the government here. I want the home I deserve."

I have discussed every single thing in the relationship, my unhealthy toxic actions too, and I was told I was the manipulated and abused one. The pain of being used for so long by someone I truly loved drove me to a serious suicide attempt a few days ago and I was in hospital until yesterday. I can’t bear contacting any of my friends because I don’t want to burden them with this. I had a plan to end my life properly on my birthday but I don’t know what’s right or wrong anymore. A part of me trusts him that he really loves me and I was the bad one, and remembers all the good things he did for me, the other part believes my instincts and psychologist but I feel like I have gone crazy from all of this and like I have no judgement left and I always have this inner feeling that I am selfish and evil and ruining other people’s lives. I can’t believe he would treat me like that. I keep thinking of the person he used to be and how he treated me. I have a lot of childhood trauma too and I just feel like I have gone crazy.

I have a great job, I have friends, I have a loving family, yet all I think about at times is just going away peacefully. I'm only living because of the fear of what my mom would do if she saw my dead body. I don't care about the status of my life, all my achievements and desires are simply for other people. I thought it was enough to surround myself with people who care about me, but it feels even more suffocating with the thought that I can't take the easy way out and just go through with it. The thought of them being sad at my death keeps me from unaliving myself more than anything else, but this is slowly starting to go away as I'm becoming more selfish and want to just stop. I see no reason in continuing life, I have zero motivation anymore to do anything.

I read other people's posts and I feel pathetic towards myself for even having these thoughts when other people have real problems. I can have anything I want and more and I still would choose to die now rather than to live the rest of my life.

I'm very close to doing something stupid and I'll make sure that theres no revival once I did it.

I'm gay, and I'm an introvert so I don't have much straight or gay friends. I'm a good-looking guy but I'm very tired. My face is full of acne scars and it's red most of the time. I have ugly stretch marks all over my body; both sides, front and back of the chest, thighs, inner thighs, butt, knee, back of the knee. I had the perfect clear skin till 17. Now, I have body image issues, my belly is big compared to my arms no matter how much exercise and diet I did. My hairline is literally receding though I have a big hair bulk as usual.

I'm a med student and I think it is Cushing's disease or syndrome but I'm very scared to face it since the only way to cure is the surgery. I'm from a moderate-earning family and my country is now in coup, so we have to live  walking around the eggshells of money. Even if I did surgery, it still remains all those stretch marks and scars and I even think this medical condition especially in the adolescence has somehow affected my growth and all those things; stretch marks, scars and growth retardation, can't be reversed or gone away. I'm so sick of them and I'm now writing at 5:17 in the morning. 

My parents including me thought it was just a phase but I struggled with this for almost 5 years and now I'm 22 and I can't do it any longer. We live in the underdeveloped country so they're not very educated about this medical condition or seeking help for my chronic symptons. And I don't wanna explain all over again.

There's the rat poison at an arm's length and I'm a good person all my life but why does it torture me in this way?

I broke up with my one and only bf because I feel very insecure and unworthy of him. He once said he can't bear it anymore since I whined about all those insecurities although he never pointed out or blamed on them. 

I don't wanna love someone again or live the drama and all I need is to end myself and start a new afterlife."

But ever since, Ive been CONSTANTLY thinking about my time in hospital. I look at the pictures of it, I read the texts my friends sent me and all that, and at this point it’s getting really boring. 

And I thought this was just a trauma response, especially bc since it happened I’ve barely been able to function and my mh is at the worst it’s been. But I’ve also realised I kind of have a longing to end up back in hospital.

I’ve heard people talk about this before but they refer to it as “ care seeking, looking for help, trying to make people realise how terrible you feel” ( and don’t get me wrong, that’s completely valid) but I think for me it was that I needed to feel valid and that my mh was serious.

Like I can never be comfortable, or happy in any moment, no matter what. When I'm not actively sad (which is rare) I'm sitting with this horrible, uncomfortable feeling that pushes me into a mentally horrible place. Theres no end to my pain because , the truth is,my pain isnt very logical. Alot of what I deal with is imaginary.  I have ocd and major depression, it's like I no longer have a place in my head where I can return to for comfort. No situations, no hope. If I feel comfortable, it's not for long and is quickly drowned out with obsessions. 

I'm suicidal but not actually going to kill myself. I know I wont, I couldnt do it to my family and also feel it is an offense to god (sorry for bringing in my beliefs if you dont share them) but I can't really logically see an end to my pain. It's so powerful and all consuming,I'm never, ever happy. I wish god was okay with suicide, I was there was a way to push a button and just be gone. I sometimes wish my family was more understand cause when I bring it up with them, they see it in a very juvenile way. Like they bring up why I should be happy, and how great I have it.  But it's not the external situations that really make me how I am. My brain is broken. It most certainly is not normal what goes on in my head. That's my rant,I hope somebody can relate."

Or why suicide is not legal. Or why I keep trying to keep holding on. Nothing in my existence makes any sense. I am. Absolutely worthless. I have no family. My abusive and narcissistic father has rejected me and ruins what little good energy I have left. My brother has fallen victim to untreated schizophrenia and tries to harm me as well as my father. Went from a college athlete to homelessness and in and out of jail. My father refuses to acknowledge his mental illness until the last moment and blames it on my brother for ""putting"" himself in the situation. The times I've seen him get kicked out in the middle of winter. Cold and no place to sleep. Wandering the streets. My father telling me the the deep cuts on my wrists were for attention, refusing to acknowledge I could be depressed when I barely take care of myself, hooked on any substance I could touch, barely graduating high school and barely surviving my Xanax overdose in the middle of a school assembly, throwing myself in the middle of traffic just to feel something, but the moment he finds out. I'm a little he has the nerve to say I'm ""disgusting"". After panicking and getting sent to a mental facility and attaining 3 MDD diagnosis in the span of 4 months he acknowledges that I might have an issue, and how better to help than to call me a spawn of Satan. How better to help me than wacth you mistreat my schizophrenic brother. The only one who was there for me, who understood the pain I experienced, we experienced together, to be ripped away from me because you think I only want drama to spread. To spread lies in his head about me to the point where he tries to physically assault m, and I can no longer visit my childhood home. No matter what, I find dissapointment, failure, misery, pain. I left the home a year ago and I quite frankly am upset that I did. 8 would not have so many belongings to clear out before I bought a gun to off myself. I don't matter. I can't keep a job. I'm the last person, the very last person anyone would have ever expected to be trans. And with a little more room in my mind I had come to the realization that I was. And with the realization it felt like everything I was working on had fallen apart yet again. Why couldn't I be what everyone expected of me? I'm a failure, and quite honestly, a disgrace to the trans community. I'm poor. No family. Z-e-r-o friends. I'm pathetic. I'm 19 years old and live with my friend and his rich family, none of which I have any connection with. Deadnamed purposely by whom I thought were my closest friends, ignored, neglected by the people I thought I could rely on who just used me. I am the only trans black woman I'll ever know. My HRT appointment is in 10 days, but honestly what's the point? I'm poor and have no insurance, and I'm do depressed and dysphoric to show some random person my ID and despise appearing as male. I'm a waste of hormone therapy. I'm a waste of the food I eat, I'm a waste of the resting place I've been given, I'm a waste of an able body, a waste of life. Why would I take hormones especially? I'm disgustingly ugly there's another trans girl who actually deserves them. If I died, I would not be missed. I would end up like a graduating classmate of mine who died two weeks after graduating. Dead. She had friends, and people who loved her. Her parents loved her dearly and I hope she is remembered. But lowlife bums like me don't deserve that kind of love or attention, which certainly explains why I am neglected so. It has all been signs my entire life that I am not meant to be alive, but somehow I keep pushing, obsessed with the thought that of I keep. Pushing it will get better when since I was 7 years old I knew I was headed nowhere. I don't even have health insurance, and no parents to show me how to get it. Why would I pay for a 200 dollar appointment when I can buy a gun for that much and cure all my mental deficits. Even Christian hell would be better than this, at least I would make someone happy with my work. To get the job I have right now xi had to pass a background check. If I passed one by the FBI, clearly, I can pass one to get a gun. Rent one of those giant dumpsters and throw my belongings away. And then what? I'll be gone, money will be saved. Lives will be better. And my homeless friend in Denver may even have a place to stay, because God knows he deserves it more than me. The worst part is, chances are I probably won't do it. But if I keep trying maybe I'll at least buy a gun with no bullets. With all this who could possibly say I have a place existing in society???? I would would never be saved in an apocalypse, so why should I be saved now? I should be executed."

I don’t see any love for me ending good because I don’t think that anybody could ever actually handle how broken I am. The fact is that they all leave once they truly see me. And that’s okay. They should be happy. I know that I’m just dragging them down. 

I don’t want to drag anybody down anymore. I don’t wanna have more people leave me. I don’t wanna live this life trying to find a gentle love that can’t exist.

I can't keep it up, I'm giving up on so many things because I can't do it anymore, I just work eat and sleep for as long as I can between work days and I stay in bed in the week-end. Trying again and again and failing each and every time at doing very simple things is awful. I don't have the motivation to do things I like anymore because I always fuck it up. 

It makes people around me say that I'm lazy, and that I don't care. I can't prove them wrong. 

I just want to disappear, I have nothing to look forward to except depression. I don't want to live those days. But I'm just a coward I don't think I could ever hurt myself. So I'm just staying here I guess. But every day is so hard.

A way to spare someone going through grief. I teetered between killing myself and running away constantly, scared of death but knowing running away would only be a matter of time before I was found.

Inside Out had just come out, I was probably the same age as Riley at the time. I was thinking about running away before the movie, so it was honestly just really inconvenient timing and I hoped my family wouldn't have been upset that they took me to see the movie and I ran away almost immediately after. 

So anyways a few days after seeing the movie I was at my cousin's house and feeling suicidal and decided to write a running away note. In his room. On his table. With his drawing paper. As he played with his toys right next to me. My tears dripped onto the paper. I remember drawing arrows to them and writing ""tears of an idiot."" I wrote how I know we just saw Inside Out but seeing the movie has nothing to do with me running. I don't know what happened to that paper but I never did end up trying to run away.

I'm older now. Anddddddd, absolutely nothing has changed. In fact, I have a new baby cousin now. I love him so much, both of them. Yet there's such a strong urge to kill myself before he grows too old and can remember me. I'm about to be 18, at the very least I could run away and it actually be legal now. Cops can't do shit.

I guess actually one thing has changed, I'm slightly more in tune with reality. Sure I could run away but for what? Live in this awful fucking heat wave? Starve? Freeze when winter rolls around? You don't have a job yet you dumbass. Just die lol. Go with that plan of yours to shoot yourself when you can finally buy a gun."

I've been considering dropping out, because a day after I enrolled my worst episode started.

But it's really ignorant, that they genuinely think terminal illness = immediate death.
People with what I have can live anywhere from 6-28 years from the onset of symptoms.
Sometimes sooner, sometimes later.

I know I shouldn't let it bother me this much, but it does.
My friends and family and doctors have seen what I've gone through first-hand, especially right now since I'm going through a bad episode.
I'm constantly in pain, my limbs lock up, I have tremors, muscle spasms, my muscles are so tight right now.
It hurts so bad. The closest way I can describe it, is it feels like someone tightly wrapping saran wrap over your legs, over and over. Tighter and tighter.
It also feels like I'm being stabbed over and over. Like my muscles are tearing.
I can't even describe the half of it. It's just so bad.

I wish I wasn't going through this. I don't wanna use a cane or a wheelchair. 
My social life is so bad. I used to like going to gay clubs, drinking (responsibly), going for long walks, etc.
I can't do that anymore. I don't think I ever will.
What I (99%) sure have, has no cure.
Some treatments to help pain and certain symptoms, but no cure.
Only 2 (?) people have gone into remission via stem cell therapy, I believe.

I've been thinking of suicide. Assisted, I guess, but suicide nevertheless.
Or the... other way. I have before and pretty much succeeded, until I was brought back, but now I know how to finish the job, so..

With the rate I'm progressing, I don't want to live confined to a wheelchair. I really don't wanna do this anymore.

I just deleted my FB profile because I mentally can't handle it. I really can't. I'm struggling so hard to hold on and not let it bother me, because nothing they say is true and everyone close to me knows that, but I don't know.
I hate this so much. I have a poor quality of life that's slowly progressing. And with this illness, some days your great and ""normal"", others are not, and eventually it's consistent and you're basically fucked unless the treatments even help lessen your symptoms.

I thought I actually reached the point of no return. I am surprised to still be alive. To be honest I will probably never kill myself. I feel dead on the inside anyway.

I feel hopeless and the reason why I am mutilating is to keep myself alive. I don't feel much (not physically wise). I do that to myself to prove that I am me and not a stranger to my own life. **I feel like a spectator rather than a living person is something wrong with me?**

The physical pain I have feels good. I am going crazy you know. I have panic attacks now, sometimes I just randomly go crazy. It feels like someone is controlling my body and I am fully aware of it and I let it happen because I am just tired. 

I won't tell you that it is going to be okay because I just don't know. I am sharing the process of me going through whatever I am going through. Tomorrow I'll book an appointment with a specialist.

Lots of pressure from my mom to succeed/be perfect when growing up, and a fear of making mistakes from my father's side. Didn't really have any other relatives as a part of my life and so didn't have anyone to really talk to.

I became an extreme people-pleaser, especially to my parents, and did academics and stuck to whatever I ""did well in"" (biology) and avoided anything that challenged me or seemed difficult (engineering, physics, being creative). So my parents encouraged me to pursue what I did well in (biology) and I somehow felt ""better"" than other people because I seemingly had my life sorted (AKA I would become a scientist like my parents, perhaps even a professor). Went to a challenging top uni, and acted like I knew what I wanted to do and just stuck with it, instead of asking myself the hard questions and facing failure and trying new things. 

Then just did everything that would be in line with this career that I ""should have"" and didn't set boundaries for work, didn't know how to maintain a healthy balance with my life, and didn't even ask myself if I wanted to actually do this.

This even extends beyond work and career. I never even put myself into other people's shoes and really thought about ""discovering"" who I am—I thought I was fixed as a person. Didn't even think about things like whether I liked something/someone, whether I was LGBTQ+, etc. because that wasn't ""normal"" and why would I waste my time on that when I am ""mature"" and know what I want to do. 

Just graduated and now see that all my friends have grown into wonderful, multi-faceted, successful adults because they asked themselves the hard questions and faced failure, whereas I am just stuck where I was when I started school because I didn't do the work to try new things and ask myself the hard questions. Uni time was supposed to have been for me and my personal growth but I just tried to skate by without having any of that. I also feel like I haven't learned that much in university anyway...

I hate myself and regret wasting all this time. I also just hate that nobody in my life ever asked me to deeply **think** about what I was doing, or that my parents never really said it was OK to not be sure about things. I just thought I was better than other people for being good at my work, but really, it just doesn't matter.

My dad did think that my mom was pushing me too much to study biology, but I just wanted to be seen as ""successful"" and having everything figured out, but right now I feel like a total failure, not just career-wise, but as a person. I feel like my personal development is at the level of a middle schooler or something now. I don't know what to do. I really see myself as an abysmal example of a human being, a TOTAL FAILURE. This sounds so dumb but legitimately I feel like so stunted mentally, and that probably nobody has seem such a poor example of a human being. I really want to kill myself right now, I don't think someone like me deserves to live."

Not even wrong time wrong place. So I have a big grudge on my aunt and uncle and how they treat my family members in the family. First of all, I'm working with them currently well not right now because of covid-19 like symptoms...

Let's get to the reason why I don't like them. 

1)  (Now deceased) They treated my mother like garbage talking about her behind her back in a family group on What's APP without my brother and I presence because we got kicked for arguing with them. She was complaining about her medication because she was having her regular flare ups from Lupus and my uncle and aunt decided to be a dick and said something out of line. I came in to their dms and cursed them out. They expected me to hug them and say they love me and all that jazz after. 

2) They're homophobic against my cousin who is in the USA now. They said that they don't want their child to get infected with his kind. 

3) They treated my grandfather like shit when he was living with them during his last days. 

4) They also treated me like shit when I'm having seizures and etc and feeling suicidal and I've told them but they assumed I was being manipulative because I got upset on What's App on my status and they never cared to looked at it now but they've somehow looked on my status for some reason and got mad at it. They never cared before but they've been nosey and never once called me about my condition. They've threatened me to come back to work and they said they don't want me at work because I have COVID and they want an apology. I laughed at that one. Apology for what? 

5) They stood there and watch as rumors of me being gay spread around and never once called me.   


So I'm here now thinking to myself trying to make them forgive me but I didn't want to at all. They're trying to trap and trick me because of ""Where else can I find work? I have nothing "" excuse. They want to throw shit at me for being a 24 year old adult and expect me to have things settled and show responsibility because I'm sharing with my family how I feel yet y'all can say whatever they want to us behind our backs? They think they're high and mighty with their fucking jobs they don't give a shit. They're neurologist and the only ones in the country type shit and they wanted some money. I called them ""Rich motherfuckers who don't care for anyone but themselves"" but they want me to apologize. 

I've been feeling depressed since primary and never gotten the help from my parents. My father especially just stood to his religious beliefs and thought that would help. Bullshit. Nobody in this family ever got bullied the way I did. Fucking horrible. But anyway ever since my grandfather and mother died I've been feeling like complete shit.

I started seeing another psych and therapist 2 years ago and tried another 6 or 7 meds to no avail.

I went to an intensive outpatient program and started to actually feel a little better and found a med that reduced my suicidal thoughts but I finished IOP and I'm back to fucking square one.

Not a single accessible suicide prevention hotline I could find in Germany. A lot of googling, a lot of numbers that are dead, and two that are not only German-language only, but also were ""all operators busy"" for like the 8 or 9 times I called.

But I'm alive right now, ain't I? Turns out the wood glue is non toxic, the lighter fuel is butane (relatively non-toxic), in packaging where it is basically impossible to drain fast. I did eat a detergent pod, idk about that. The fucking melatonin bottle took me several minutes of effort to tear open, turns out I'm an idiot and there is no known lethal dose; Yet still it was clearly designed to be extremely difficult to get more than a couple mililitres at a time.

I can't think about the fact they will take away all options of killing myself they can, without giving me any to actually improve my life or my mental state.

I don't have the balls to jump out the window for now, but I totally understand why students here jump in front of Subways, there's no help anywhere, and no easy way out. I have been trying for over 4 months with the university to get some help with my mental health, but the data privacy laws prevent them from keeping our info for over 6 months, and turns out quite frequently you'll be kicked off the waiting list before you get an appointment. With the health insurance, there is no way to assure you can get the required first consultation session (""SprechStunde"") in English or my native languages.

TBH I don't even know what to do, you'll see me most days and I'm this jolly bubbly YA, I fear I may be bipolar or something, the thought of killing myself is insane, it makes no sense, yet it did not stop me last night from drinking a bottle of melatonin, some wood glue and laundry detergent. It feels to me like I have a parasite in my head, and I just spend my days waiting for it to get the courage to just jump infront of the subway or from the roof once and for all.

I am 27 years old, I live with my parents in a small isolated town in italy, I have no job and have never had a romantic partner. I am totally alienated from the world and society. I am apathetic and depressed.

I am ashamed of myself, I don't want to show myself around for fear of running into someone I know and answering questions like ""how are you?"" or ""what are you doing?"". So I isolate myself in my room. The only things I do are helping my parents with household chores, run some errands and such.

I lost many years in college. Every class, every exam seemed like torture, I never had the will to study on my own. Anxiety blocked me every day, I couldn't ask professors questions, I couldn't socialize much with my classmates. Eventually I managed to pass all the exams, all but one: the final graduation exam that takes place in front of a graduation committee, and consists of a public defense of a thesis. I can't do it, I can't write a thesis, and I can never take such an exam. Maybe I don't even like this subject that much. All this time, all the money my parents have spent, it is all useless because I am useless.

I never knew what to do in life, I feel empty and purposeless, I have no passions and no strong interests. Every thing to do seems like a crazy step. Everyone is moving on in their lives, finding jobs, getting married, planning to buy houses and have children. On the other hand I stand idle in my bubble, unable to even make a phone call.

I tried going to the gym, working out, learning a language, etc. At first everything seems to go well but then I lose interest and will. I was in therapy for several months, even took drugs. They didn't help me, maybe because I didn't want to help myself. I don't want to fight, I'm tired, I just want to shut down. I plan to kill myself at the end of the summer. I have no way to get the fancy equipment, so I'll have to do it the old-fashioned way, jump off a nearby bridge.

I know many people can point to significant life events (job loss, break up, etc.) as markers for when their mental health began to decline but i’m really more interested in learning how your actual thinking evolved. Did you have any sort of epiphany that nudged you closer to attempting? Were there any fears that you consciously or subconsciously overcame to make peace with the possibility that you might actually take your own life? Did you research or take on any new philosophies that may have influenced you to now consider suicide a viable option?

For some context, I’m really scared that i’ve crossed into a new phase of ideation recently. I have been passively suicidal for a few years now but in that time I was never too worried that i would ever act on those thoughts. Any serious contemplation would usually lead me to thinking about all the reasons why I should not kill myself (the pain my death would cause my loved ones, the hope that things will get better eventually, etc.) For years those few things did a great job at stopping me in my tracks when it came to ever truly considering suicide. 

Fast forward to about two months ago. I seemingly woke up one morning without a single care in regards to that list of reasons why I should stay alive. Of course i’m still able to consider those reasons to live but now it feels like they have virtually no influence when I catch myself weighing out pros and cons. 
Ive been trying really hard to “reinstate” the gravity those reasons to stay alive for carried but I fear that there isn’t a way to revert my thinking. It feels like the curtain has been pulled back and Ill never be able to rely on those old coping strategies again in a sincere way.

Can anyone relate to this type of “mental threshold” crossing? Did your old coping strategies evolve to a new degree? How much time passed between your earliest passive suicidal thoughts and you actually attempting suicide? What would be some seriously concerning warning signs that I should keep an eye out for with my own thoughts and behavior? Was there a “straw that broke the camels back” moment that turned your mental rumination into real physical urges or impulses?"

Me (19F) have always been depressed and border suicidal even when I was a child. I remember having thoughts about wanting to die when I was like 6 or 7, and thinking it was normal. That is until my brother found out and threatened to tell our parents. He didn't, so luckily they don't know, and he was only 9 then so I doubt he himself remembers. 

I had been getting better over the years and stopped wishing I was never born or that I was dead. But a few weeks ago I just broke, there wasn't really any trigger it just kinda happened. I have been really stressed with school and my home life. Since I just had to pay for my next college semester roughly 1 grand  (I'm fucking broke) and then my car broke down...twice so now I have to pay another 2 grand for that. I would go to a hospital and get treatment but since I'm extremely suicidal rn I'm sure they would lock me up for a while, but I can't do that because I would miss classes (mom forced me to take the summer term with max classes) and I can't afford to miss classes or fail.

 I'm also failing one of my classes because I couldn't find any of the hw assignments online, and I sent many emails to the professor asking where the assignments are and he never responded. So I've been super stressed over that, and I already have super high anxiety, to the point where going out to buy food takes me a few days to be able to open the door and leave. It's really bad, my grandma is the same way, so maybe it's genetics or some shit.

But I've been just so stressed and anxious and it doesn't help that I live with my narcissistic parents who make me drop whatever I'm doing to cater to them. My parents think that I revolve around them, and god knows what would happen to me if I 'talked back'. Even this morning I got woken up so that my mom could yell at me for ""Half assing everything"" when last night I brought the trash out, but forgot a full can since we had just gotten a new one. She also wants to put the cat litter box in my room since she just 'adopted' a baby (from my mentally insane sister) and he's staring to crawl and trying to mess with it. She first said the litter box could either go in the bathroom or my bedroom, but when I said to put it in the bathroom she refused saying that my dad wouldn't like that because he uses the tub at night, and their bathroom only has a shower while mine has the only tub. So she's refusing to put it in the bathroom because my dad would get mad, when he only uses it once a day at night. While I literally live in my bedroom, so I would be smelling it 24/7. Really shows her priorities. Fair tho because my dad has anger issues and has threatened to beat my brother and I skull in on multiple different occasions for talking back'

I actually only realized how narcissistic and manipulative my parents were in highschool thanks to some friends. But I've lived with it for so long it doesn't really faze or bother me, I just my normal. But the stress from the bills and school have just fucked my brain over, and I just can't take it anymore. My depression came back full force and I've done nothing but cry for the past few weeks. I decided I can't take it anymore and Im gonna kill myself. I've been making plans for a few weeks and I already have picked how I'm gonna kill myself, but Im not sure where just yet. 

I've even made a list of my most important possessions and who I want them to go to after I kill myself. I've also made a bucket list of things to do before I do it, and a list of people who I'm gonna write personal letters to apologizing. I know how badly I'm gonna hurt my friends as In Highschool I lost someone very close to me because of suicide and I cried for months. And still choke back tears when I think of him. But I just can't handle it anymore.

I love my friends and MOST of my family, but the things that hurt most to leave behind are my cats and my nephews and nieces. I love my friends just as much as I love them but they'll eventually get over my loss. My cats tho might think I've abandoned them, and never know that I died, I mean in a way I am abandoning them, one is only 2 yrs old and the other is 10 almost 11, so he's at the end of his life, but I just can't stand to leave them. I would have killed myself as a child if it wasn't for Mittens, so I have no idea how I could ever forgive myself for doing that to them

And my nephews and nieces, I love them so much, I don't want kids because I'd rather be the cool aunty, and they love me, whenever they see me they shout my name and run into my arms, but they're still young only 7, 5, 1 yr ,8 months, and a baby still on the way. But the 7 yr old and 5 yr old are so precious to me, I can't even imagine how hurt they would be, and traumatized. Especially since they don't yet know what death is, and what if they forget about me completely when they get older since they're still so young. But at the same time I want them to forget because I don't want them to be traumatized.

Idk, I was making more plans about my death earlier and my cat Bella just jumped onto my desk and started rubbing her face against mine, right when I wrote down that she would go to my brother. I lost it and completely started bawling my eyes out and she just sat there loving on me and nudging her face against me, I held her and cried into her and than started going into a panic attack, telling her that I didn't want to leave her, and how much I love her but that I just couldn't handle it. I know she doesn't understand me, but it felt like she did, especially when she slapped the pen out of my hand. As if telling me not to make plans to kill myself.

Unfortunately it did not go the way I was hoping it’d go because I woke up the next day and when I woke up I experienced really bad nausea. The best way to describe it was that my stomach felt like really bad car sickness and my head felt like I just spun around for a solid 5 minutes with even the slightest movement making my body wanna vomit for example tilting my head or simply standing up. I have been feeling like that all day although it has gotten better throughout the day. Another weird thing I experienced throughout my day is that my heart rate would suddenly jump up at random times like I just did a intense workout. 

Besides that I haven’t had any other notable symptoms, but overall it sucked. I didn’t eat anything today due to how much more sick it will make me and even though my head has felt better throughout the day I still have this light headache which is annoying to deal with."

My ego destroyed my career, and lost without the career I always fought for, I cheated on my ex (and perhaps due to karma, I also lost millions in this bear market). Don't feel sorry about me. I'm about to go anyway. Just wanted to share my story.

I graduated from a top 5 uni in the us. Went to work on wall street for a couple of years before moving to another city in Asia, still within financial industry. 

I think because of my experiences in NYC there's always a ""I'm better than you"" vibe about me, at least according to my ex. It's not that I don't want to be humble, I've been humbled by life, but guys (and finance is a male dominant industry) just never liked me much while girls always did. I was very lucky to have had two very good bosses back in the states though.

Perhaps everything started three years ago, when I was fired from company A in the new city. It was okay, never liked company A anyway because of the culture. And I guess I never tried to hide it either. I mean it was a small french bank, and they discussed business in french. I don't speak french. In the end I was let go for being a bit quiet. Fine, whatever. I thought I deserved better, and I did get a much better job just about pretty immediately (think of bank B). 

Finance is a small industry, so everyone pretty much knows everyone or at least knows someone that knows everyone. I wasn't trying to hide it when I interviewed with bank B, told them straight up I was let go. But filled out employment forms with bank B wrong because I thought it was not important and / or didn't want to admit I was let go on paper. Whatever the reason was, I was let go from bank B pretty much filling a form wrong.

It was also around this time I met the love of my life. She stayed with me from bank A to B, through all the hardships. I thought she was the love of my life. I deeply loved her. But something she did (meeting a guy and tried to hide it from me, she told me afterwards they were just friends) always haunted me. We fought alot, by alot I mean twice three times a week. I wouldn't be able to sleep the entire night, would always end up going to work tired. We were together for three years, and during the last two years I worked for bank C (yes I was still able to get jobs despite having two very short term experiences). I tried my best to be a good boyfriend, paid all the bills, fine dining occasionally. She liked outdoor activities, but I was just too tired during the weekends so I ended up sleeping all day. I guess I was just boring.

My direct manager at bank C hated me. But the big boss liked me. Whether the lack of sleep caught up with me or I've been stripped off my knowledge, in the end I was let go again (they told me to resign) in the midst of this political drama.

I started blaming my ex for this to happen. Never has anybody I've known worked in front office with 3 hours of sleep every night for two years without it taking atoll on their mental and physics. But she disagreed. It's my own fault for not being liked by people. Guess she could be right.

So I've now been unemployed for almost a year. During the first few months being jobless, I started going out, drinking. Met a girl, we pretty much liked each others immediately. Guess you can call it cheating. I thought I was done with my ex anyway.

As lost as I was with life, I wasn't really sure how I felt for either of them. So there was crossover a couple of times. Guess I cheated on both of them in the end. It wasn't that I intentionally wanted to. The new girl was everything a guy ever dreamed about. it started as fling and developed into more feelings. 

My ex at this point exited this drama (yes they talked) and I was with this new girl. 

I was still unemployed, but had a good savings from past bonus payments. Lost it all during the past few months. At this rate, I started to push the new girl away. Didn't want her to suffer with me. I ended up breaking up with her three times. And by the third time she made sure I'll never find her again (blocked me on everything). She now absolutely hates me. And I never found her again.

By now I have just enough money/savings to last another two months in this city. I have nowhere to go. I have no job, no friends and hurt two women that loved me.

I still try to pick myself up by applying for jobs, buts I also feel I'm fading away day by day mentally. I'm scared of future, scared of life. The only thing that will release me from all this pain is suicide. I think by the time my money runs out,  I will finally be able to do it."

My family who lack the characteristics of being a family. Friends who've decided to move on with their own lives and I feel like they've forgotten about me. My co-workers. Former schoolmates. The women whom I've had relationships with. People who liked me. People who hated me. I've always wondered how they would react once they find out I've ended myself.

What sucks is, you're way too dead to witness how they would react once they find out when you've ended yourself. Because to me, that's the only idea I have of having any hope that they would start caring... or maybe not. Maybe they'd be indifferent to it.

1754,my girlfriend cheated on me after a year of going out,w1nqat,SuccotashBubbly6457,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1nqat/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_after_a_year_of_going/,8,SuicideWatch,True,This is not the only reason I'm here but is a pretty big reason as to why. She's already cheated on me once (I should have ended it then but I'm a dumbass). After I caught her cheating the first time she said she was drunk and was sorry (this was my first relationship and I'm 16 so this may seem a bit childish). After looking back on it she wasn't drunk and cheated on me multiple times after what baffles me more is this bitch was doing it while I was in the hospital after trying to commit suicide. She knew I was a vulnerable person (she knew what I was like when we started dating)what makes this worse Is that I had so much fun with her and she was one of the best things to happen to me and then and then she's fucking other people when I'm in the hospital

1757,The absolute worst feelings so far,w1xcb1,TheRogu3DM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1xcb1/the_absolute_worst_feelings_so_far/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I've had depression for about 10 years. But how I'm feeling right now is by far the lowest low I've ever been. Even when I was in high school and every single of my friend group turned on me and wished me dead. Even when I was trapped against my will in Fort Benning. I feel worse. I've had an existential crisis along with this episode. Looking at all the pets I've had throughout my life and how I have something I regret not doing for each of them. Looking at the fact that, assuming I don't do the deed, I'm going to wake up one morning with my parents dead, my grandparents dead, aunts and uncles dead. And realize I'm next in line to go. That's one of the only reasons I haven't done it yet. The idea my parents will wake up one day and I'm gone. I thought about leaving a timed message as a suicide note for my parents, my girlfriend, my best friend etc. Listing off the reasons they're great and that this isn't their fault and that I want to live life to the fullest for me. This is just word vomit, but I felt like I had to post something. Last night I had a dream. I was at my grandmother's house and while hanging out, ran into my old long gone dog, a brown lab. We were hugging each other and crying and it felt so warm and loving. I can't help but feel like that was a sign. Telling me that if I die, she'll be there to comfort me in the afterlife."

- Faith/God/Religion: Everyone's uncertain at best.

- Dreams & Goals: Assume I achieve them... Then what? Make more? That sounds forced & exhausting. But honestly, I don't have any as it is. What's the point? To distract myself?

- Family: They're just people. Not a huge fan of most of them anyways. Plus, if I stay for them, then they remain unhurt while I *still* suffer...

- Friends: See 'Family', but I get to choose who I see.

- Career: Just where you get money. Some aren't as taxing on your health as others.

- To grow as a person: 'Grow' how? And what would it have mattered when I die?

- For others who look up to you: ...Who will *also* die.

I just don't get it. Nothing seems worth staying for. It's all just feels like a distraction until we die."

1760,First part of my story,w1x1bs,Anonymousprofile04,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1x1bs/first_part_of_my_story/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I wanna die, my life is shit, this is looking worst than any novel. I want all my life exposed anonymously somewere so I can at least know it wasn't all silence until the end. I'm the youngest of 3 brothers, older male, the middle female. I'll start by the relationship of my parents, toxic, not good. I'm my house there was never apologizes, never a ""sorry"" when one of them did something bad to us. I watched TV and books and when they done that I always felt cringe and that the scene was awkward, now that I'm an adult I learned from other people that apologizing is normal. My dad works out of country, only comes one a week on holidays so he can spend some time with us. I almost don't know him and the last time he was with me and my sister he said ""I don't know my daughters"" and I understand that it's true. One crismas My dad and my mother buyed a pc, a tablet and a printer and it was gifts for us three but I think they got an argument about the money and I just remember me in the living room playing ps2, my dad pass by in front of me and by that accidentally disconecting the controller. He took the 3 presents and then the loud argument begun. My brother took me and my sister to his room and we hear ""im going out of this house!"" And the sound of a bag being open. My brother and sister were crying, I wasn't (I still am confused to why, I wasn't that young to not show emotions). Next holiday I thing my parents had a ""conversation"" and my dad was back but again another argument and this time my sister tried to go to my father when he said he was getting out ""Dont do that please, that's not how things should work"" she said ""you dont talk to me like that!"" My father took her arm and pressed it to the wall, I got so scared bc my dad never got physical (my mother always hits us but my father? never before and never after this) my brother took us to our room and she started crying. My brother was so full of this house he took his headphones and went outside. My mother saw us and went to my father and tried to talk, no more arguments that day but you can all guess the feeling of having and ""elephant in the room"" they are now divorced, finally, but even that they did it bad, it had to be my sister going with one of them at a time to sign the papers bc ""I talk, he/she is who doesn't want to talk"", I was a minor at that time, the divorce was officially the day before the first case of COVID in my country. I hate how they put so much pressure on my sister, she didn't deserve any of that. But now you ask"" and your older brother?"" Well here's the next part, My older brother, he run away from home, things here weren't looking good to it's side. But before that I need to share that me and my brother share one love in life, video games, sadly my mother hated them so there was this rule ""video games just on holidays and if with good grades"" me and my brother weren't as intelligent as our sister so we needed to work hard for it so with this what my mother told us is ""you have to have good grades to play games"" but then my brother reached 18 and rules changed I think and he could play anytime, my mother never encouraged us to study for our future the right way (did she ever encouraged us? I think she always manipulated or threaten us all our lives). My brother couldn't get in a near university but a friend of our mother helped us and he could at least one 2 hours from home. My parents were paying everything and he just needed to go, after a while he started to almost never come home and sometimes he came with things he brought with what money? We discover he got a girlfriend and her mom gave him a job and he stopped going to university and now lives with the girlfriend. Everyone looks at him like a bad guy because he cut connections at home, almost with me and my sister too bc he just call us on holidays or birthdays and we do the same. I never told this to anyone but I understand him. He was technically the only boy in the house and was always pushed apart in some subjects. My mother hit him the most (now she just hits me) and always yelled so much bad things. I want to run away from my mother too but I don't want to cut connections to the rest of the family but maybe he's angry that no one saved him, that no one stop my mother, sometimes I think like that but I remember that my mother isn't a bad person to other people. Sometimes I miss him, sometimes I remember I still was developing my personality when he got out so he doesn't really know me, sometimes I feel nothing at all. My sister, she's... Perfect. She's studying medicine, a A+ student, beautiful girl, good taste in everything, modest, funny...my best friend. I could be here all day saying good things about her but yes she has bad points too, she relies a little too much on me. She needs to study a lot, and my mother works so who is going to clean the house? Me. ""Come and help me."" I say ""no, I need to study. You were going to play games so you should clean the house."" I didn't choose for her to go to medicine, I didn't choose for her to have to study a lot, I want to have time for me too (sometimes I think I'm being selfish sometimes I think she is the selfish one). She is away now from home for 2 weeks doing a camp job, she left me alone with my mom for 2 weeks... I think she didn't even think about that but this is going so bad since day one. I'm scared of killing myself by this weeks (beacause this as been worse then hell everyday) and that she blames herself, she doesn't deserve the guilt, my mom does. My mom is so bad mom, since the beginning, she did good in some parts, I know how to see what good and whats mad, but the other stuff? The love? It was all wrong, she thinks that hitting us is love. The other day she got home, I had cleaned all the house and was happy for her to arrive and see but I went to play while waiting. She got home ""what is this shit? It's a mess! And this papers?!"" It's her papers she left everywhere in the house everytime. ""They aren't in place why?!"" There is no specific place for them, she went to me and push me out of my chair, closed the computer so fast he turned off and started to hit me and push me without stopping, I'm 18 now, this was just the other day, the first day my sister was out, my mom is always worst when my sister is out. She was yelling, telling me the worst, I'm a mess, I'm dirty, I don't know how to do anything. She is always body shaming me, I'm not a cis girl, I identify and semi girl, I'm not very feminine and my mother hates that (she doesn't know I'm not 100% women, just the not feminine part) I like my hair in my legs but my mom always yells is not hygienic and that one day she will take an eraser and she would cut it against my will. In one argument when I was 16 I told her I tried to kill myself when I was 15,she laughed and called me crazy and the day after she was making fun ""so let me see, you took the sciser and was like 'hooo I'm gona kill myself! Pleaseeee boys give me attention!"" I tried to kill myself because I always had bullying since 2 grade to 7 grade (when I tried to kill myself) it was just too much to me, the laugh, the jokes, I never tried to kill myself again because of the idea of her laughing at my funeral. I have a chronic disease, colite ulcerosa, I suffer too much of it and was diagnosed 3 years ago, I stop the pills when my mom gives me difficult days so maybe I'll die faster but it just gives me lot of pain, no death. I don't wanna live anymore, I'm just so tired of breathing, I have no achievement I wanna complete in life and the only things that I enjoy is video games, music, books. I never dated, no one ever liked me (except one guy in my last class that was a creep that even touched me without consent  and I think I almost got traumatized and beacause I was the only girl in 27 boys, seriously, never told anyone in the class. I told my mom, didn't take it serius.) There so much messed stuff I might talk about in the future, theres so much worse messed up stuff I don't even know how to write it but I'm leaving this one this way. I don't even know if I'm finish my life today, everyday is always the same question ""is it worth anymore?"" Bc I don't have a future, no good grades to get me to university, I don't even have a body for most of the jobs, what am I gonna do if I wake up with a lot of pain just like most days? Tell my boss I'm not coming? Life is shit and I hate it."

I can’t count on one hand the number of times I’ve been on here. Again to no surprise I am back as I am ‘going’ to kms tonight. Probably will chicken out again. The time spans between me going on here are only getting smaller it’s scary to think about eh. I have thought everything through and I see no reason and have no want to live anymore.
I just don’t want to cause family and friends suffering. I wish I never was born. To slit my throat and wrist, to hang myself, to overdose- who knows. Im thinking of walking onto a busy road and laying down. That way my family won’t be the ones to find my dead body. I don’t know. I can’t cut deep enough, I can commit enough. I’m a 14 year old girl from Australia. Not much more to me. So I’ll see you all in the next journey of death. The eternal darkness. Pretty poetic huh, cringe if anything. No one will ever truly love me, they all hate me in secret. I’m unloveable, there’s no hope for someone like me. I don’t want to witness anymore of what this world has to offer. I just want to end it all. I’m tired. My friends are sick of me, so are my family. I’m so sorry. I just can’t live any longer. I can’t breathe. Anyways time to go die and escape this world."

It's like I'm so far behind, just broken, I can never catch up. I can never be like them. I can never be what I want, it's to late for me. All I can do is just wait or exit myself.

Or it feels like I could do things but the chances of success are so slim, it feels futile. Like a mountain to climb, but even if you climb the mountain the chance for a nice view is slim.

It's really rather dramatic of me since, I suppose I'm really not that tragic. But I would consider myself broken or defective rather. I just don't have any faith in myself, it's completely gone.

I have a lot a of things bothering me but ill try to go over the main points. I lost a really good friend I made at a psych ward back in 2021 and haven't been able to talk to her for four months because of something I did though there's a chance I might be able to get her back, but it is eating me away inside not knowing if I will ever get to hear her laugh again or have a conversation. I'm also having terrible anger hate and sadness/ mood swings. I can go from 1 minute being sad to another moment having my fist in the wall. My psychologist is coming to the conclusion that I have BPD and I may be diagnosed with it soon which is probably the reason for the mood swings. But not only is it making me upset its making my mom unable to go to work since November and keeps making her upset. and my dad has 0 idea how to help and doesn't fully understand though he wants to help, but we argue a lot. though I know he cares because he told my mom he feels like crying because he doesn't want to see me like this as for the rest of my family they don't really affect me negatively or that much positively. there's also so much loss in the family, for the last 10 years there has been at least 1 death a year and even if I didn't know them that well it still affects my family which affects me. I just feel so hopeless and even had to call the hotline 2 days ago which led to me being taken to the ER though nothing came of it. there's so much more and tbh Its decently late and I'm really tired so sorry if stuff didn't make sense."

The only representation I see of people like me is that of the ignorant snob who doesn't care about anyone else and is only interested in sex/money/power. That is of course because that's what a large majority of people like me are.

It feels like I can only either deny it or just accept it. I'm only a teenager so it's not like I can go out and protest. If I were to try and defend myself and tell myself that just being these things doesn't make me a bad person, that's just like me saying ""not all whites/men/rich people!"" and that's just kinda cringe.

I want people to like me, but I am literally every evil in this world rolled into one person. Then there's the second layer of me feeling bad about myself making me a stereotypical ""whiney white guy"" who boo-hoo's about how social change hurts his feelings. Come to think of it, most of the things I do have been my trying to crawl away from being this embodiment of societal evil (even though I have done nothing wrong to deserve to call myself that).

Just existing like this makes me feel all kinds of bad. Some days it's more ""You have all these privileges, you aren't really suffering. Grow up and stop feeling sorry for yourself"" or ""People who have less than you have already graduated or invented great things and all you do is sit around playing videogames you fat piece of sh\*t.

It has been four months since he dumped me. We still haven’t talked about it. All he said was “soon”. 

I need to let go of him, but I don’t understand why we can’t work it out. I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just long distance and his father died. I did offer to be there. He said no.

Everything is poison and on fire. It feels like the end of the world is getting closer and closer and he left me all alone.

I do have friends and family. I know there are other people who care about me. I know that. I am funny, witty, clever and  resourceful. I am kind and giving. I’m going on another trip to be surrounded by friends who can’t wait to see me.

So why am I imagining suicide? It’s not the actual act but the impact I’ve been thinking about. Why can’t I make it stop? I can’t sleep. This makes no sense. It is ridiculous. 

Should I call my psychologist’s office? Not now, but like in the morning. Is this an actual emergency? I think I can wait.

Logging into social media all you see is ignorant behavior and exaggerated lifestyles, we’re all human but it’s safe to say a lot of us are a complete waste of space & resources.

If I kill myself before moving out she’ll have to clean everything out and I can’t bear the shame of taking myself from her and forcing her to move me out after I’m gone. I need to move out soon because I can’t do this anymore. I’ve burned pretty much every bridge. All I think about is getting high or drunk enough to pass out or be able to at least exist normally for a bit. I’ve ruined everything I wanted and dreamed about because I’m poison. I destroy everything I touch and I’ve never known how to fix it or why I even do it. The most recent of these fuck ups is what’s really really driving me to realize I need to go. My ex and I were close after we broke up because we still had feelings for each other and it was a complicated break up. She went to college and we stayed marginally in touch and for a while, she was on my mind daily and I couldn’t stop thinking about her and how much I’d fucked up, I thought for sure she had lost all feelings for me. Come to find out after reading her more I started to understand those feelings didn’t really go away for her at all. She’s dating someone from her college and it started a few months or so after we broke up so it added to my reasoning for letting go of me. This summer she came back for vacation and it had been normal for us to hang out even after breaking up because ig I assumed she had no feelings for me. She admitted to me a couple months ago that she was still in love with me but knew I’m not good for her, that sometimes you have to choose what’s healthy rather than what you want. I’m horrible for her, she’s impulsive around me because of my lifestyle and how she has a split want for her life. Part of her wants to be middle class with a good job and a happy family. Another part of her wants to live freely and do drugs and have fun. I’m the same way but I’m not moving towards the good path unfortunately. She wants that good path and I want it for her too because I’m in love with her, her happiness means the most to me even if I’m not with her. We were getting closer this summer and a few days ago we got drunk together and started getting intimate. We were standing on the rocks by the river in our hometown late at night hugging and she leaned in and kissed me, it was one of the most passionate kisses she ever laid on my lips and we immediately got really into it. I knew it was wrong because she was with another, but I didn’t care, I didn’t think of the implications because my emotions were all that mattered at that point. I offered that we walk to my car and we ended up fucking in the back seat intensely, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. To keep the details of that heinous act short ill move on because it’s not important. What’s important is that I ruined everything. I can’t even be friends with her anymore. I promised myself I’d put her and her relationship first and never let anything happen between us no matter the circumstances and I failed. When we started to initially realize that I make her impulsive and make bad decisions we had a running kind of promise that if we could both get ours lives in order we could be together possibly and it could be great, but I destroyed that chance. I love her, but I didn’t show it right, I could have showed it correctly by respecting her life and relationship, her decisions and interests. There’s nothing for me. I’ve ruined almost all of my friendships and I have no goals. I don’t have hobbies or dreams or a reason other than this shit in my childhood room I need to clean out. I can’t walk this earth anymore, my legs hurt and sitting down offers no solace. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I was given so many opportunities and threw them away for nothing. I will never learn my lesson until I teach myself my last lesson. I’m sorry"

Was very addicted to opiates (mainly oxycodone) for around 3 years and I’ve been clean from all drugs for around 8 months now. 

During my addiction I acquired a theft charge and I am currently on unsupervised probation with a suspended 180 day sentence. Meaning, if I don’t get in legal trouble during the next 9 months I’m good. (in Iowa). 

Over the weekend, I made a bad mistake and drove while intoxicated. Got pulled over and arrested. This is my first DUI, but it will obviously be a violation of my probation. 

I’m a mechanic and I’ve already talked to the shop owner and he said I will most likely be able to keep my job. Literally the only up-side to this. 

Prior to this weekend, I was feeling like I was finally getting my life on track. My mind and body were getting back to normal after abstaining from drugs for so long. I was finally out of the debt I acquired during my addiction and from my legal charges.

Fast forward to right now, I just don’t know if I can do it anymore. My suicidal thoughts are coming back and my anxiety and depression are as bad as they’ve ever been. I have no friends I can talk to about any of this and I just feel so broken, lost, and a complete waste of space. 

I was raised in a good home with both parents, never had to worry about money growing up. I have one sister who is obviously the favorite because she completed college and has never been in legal trouble. I’m the black sheep of the family. 

Sorry for the long post I just needed to let it all out. I felt like I took 1 step forward by getting a good result from my previous case and beating addiction. And now feeling like I’m taking 2 steps back with this situation. I’m just so broken and every time I think I’ve hit rock bottom, I somehow find a way to go even lower. Just don’t know how much longer I can live with being a disappointment/failure to myself and my family.

Besides, I'm depressed for my own reasons ( no friends, no gf, low income job, no interesting life,  appearance ) and for external reasons (because I don't like this world, biology, reproduction, I envy women, etc) and being depressed for external things related to my gender (male) that will never change...it doesn't make sense to even talk about this because it won't change.

I already tried to commit suicide, I jumped off a bridge, drowned, lost consciousness and should have died that night but unfortunately they saw me, I was saved by a guy, and then the ambulance  take me to the emergency room, and I am supposed to be grateful to him, it was a heroic act but I am not grateful.

I really don't know what other methods to use or where to do it but it is clear to me that my fate, and that of men in general, is shitty so I want to speed up the process."
1833,Dont treat me like a patient.,w1f1h2,removedI,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1f1h2/dont_treat_me_like_a_patient/,5,SuicideWatch,False,"Yesterday I drank way too much and had a total breakdown. I was a wreck and was crying and screaming on my own. When my friends found me I opened up about the suicidal thoughts because I just couldn't bear it anymore. They were supportive and brought me to my parents who after a long time of even more crying managed to calm me. They were also very supportive. I'm now moving in with them again and will start therapy in hopes of improving my state of mind. 

EVERYONE was supportive and still is. Yet... I feel like shit. I don't seem to be the same person to them. They double check on me constantly and my friends )offer to listen. I feel like over night everything has changed. They treat me like a butterfly. 

Generally speaking I am glad to finally change something but I feel like I am a burden to everyone (which I objectivly am). I just want to go back to living my normal life again. I feel ungratefull but the entire situation makes me unconftable. I stopped lying to people about my suicidal thoughts and admit them and also admitted my weed addiction but every time someone wants to talk about those things it gets harder. 

I know that they just want to help but I feel embarrassed and weak. I just needed to get this of my chest. Thank you."
1834,The guilt making me sucidal because i said something wrong to my female therapist and Why is she not accepting my apology at all?,w1qt0d,intelectloser,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1qt0d/the_guilt_making_me_sucidal_because_i_said/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"I am 26 male and she is 28 female we had 6 sessions in the past 2 months. and in between, I expressed my feelings to her that I liked her. She did not talk much about that openly and I get that nothing can happen between us.

Eventually, I was getting obsessed with her and wanted her to like me back and always trying to get more of her attention which she is not giving to me. And that's made me feel worse.

In my 8th session, I decided that I have to change the therapist because I am crossing the boundaries now and I know my feelings are getting toxic.

I told her that I want to change my therapist she asked for a reason and I told her that I am getting toxic over her. 

She said is it your final decision?, I said yes. She said ok take care will let you know within a day or two if there is any therapist available for you. It was a 5-7 minutes session.

The next day I was feeling so bad, and I can't stop thinking about her that now I won't be able to meet her, I was devastated and broke, I was crying hard the whole day it was unmanageable and I started to get suicidal thoughts.

That night I sent a lengthy mail to her in which I vented that how she is not accepting me and how depressed I am. How she is not understanding my situation. 
She is not a good therapist she is faking care and she does not give a fuck about their patients and all that. 
I was frustrated at that time because I only had her email address to communicate with her.

I waited 2 days since I didn't get any response. I instantly realize that I should not have sent that email. I was feeling guilty as hell. Now the only thing I wanted is an apology.

Again I typed a lengthy apology email and apologized for each word I have said to her so far. But unfortunately, I did not get a response. And that's the time when I get completely broke and alone because she was not listing to me. I was again getting symptoms of depression because of the guilt I was having.

The next day in the evening I found her Instagram and messaged her there hoping she will understand how bad I am feeling about everything I just want her to accept my apology. I woke up the whole night waiting to light up my phone.

But the next morning I saw that she blocked me on Instagram I instantly messaged her on her second account and within an hour I got blocked there too.

I just closed my room and cried so hard. I was can't figure out what should I do? I sent a voice mail while crying and told her everything I was going through. And begged her to save my life but as usual, she didn't respond.

The same day I decided to go to the hospital to meet in person even though I don't have any appointments.

When I reached there I ask the guard if I need to meet her. The guard talked to her over the phone for a while and then told me that your therapist is on leave today and she didn't say when should i come next. 

I forcefully got into the therapy room because I was sure that the guard is lying to me. But the guard grab my hand and asked me to leave asap from there.

And I was waiting outside for 3 hours hoping I could see her. But I returned home disappointed.

The next day again I visited the hospital, I decided I just want to talk to her at any cost even if I have to wait the whole day. It was 9.00 am I showed my OPD card to the guard and he said wait here I'll let you know when she will come.

At noon another therapist called me into the room. She was the supervisor she said that you can not meet your previous therapist because the boundaries had been crossed and you will be transferred to a senior male therapist because she is not able to handle you because she is not experienced yet.

I said ok I agree with you, I just want one last session and want to say sorry. she instantly shouted at me and said why don't you understand it is not possible, feeling sorry is nothing it's bullshit. I was crying in front of her but she didn't listen to me.

They transferred my case to a senior male therapist as soon I confronted him I started crying again because I was broke and nobody was listening to me. 

I told him that I want to meet her at least once to apologize for everything I have said to her. And after an hour he is convinced and said I will talk to her.

While leaving the hospital I saw her but as soon as she saw me she changed her way and returned which hits me so hard. It felt like I am a molester or something like that she doesn't bother to see my face. I was crying in the metro.

In the next appointment, I saw my previous therapist sitting with her senior. It was a joint session. I was happy but at the same time feeling ashamed. During the whole session, I didn't make any eye contact with her because I was feeling ashamed I was just looking at the floor.

They were talking to each other about my case and they did not talk to me. And I was waiting for the senior therapist to allow me to talk to my therapist but in the end, he said ""ok, we will see you in the next session and she will not be here I will be the one who is taking your session""
I was still waiting that someone to allow me to express what I was feeling but they asked me to leave. 

I was getting more depressed, it was the worst stage of my life so far.

After a week on 16 July 2022, I decide I will send her one last email for an apology ( I indirectly indicated that I am suicidal) and asked her to meet at a place at 5.00 pm after work even though I know it was a waste. she won't come. But I was so desperate to say sorry to her.
Again I get no response.

I waited there till 6.00 pm and she didn't come.
Before leaving, I typed one last time ""Goodbye:)""

And now here I am severely depressed and broken even though I don't have words to express my sadness and guilt.

Every day I say my myself it was my fault, it was my fault and cry. And slowly it is now pushing me to the edge.

I have already written down my suicide note and waiting for the right time, not because of her, but just because I won't be able to carry the guilt I am having. 

Now I know I won't be able to seek any other therapist because I've lost the trust that they also won't understand my feelings.

And I don't know how to cope with this I am dragging my life. I have so much baggage and, it is already because I have Anxiety disorder mixed with depression and PTSD.

It was my fault, I always lose people to my stupidity."

No one talks to me irl, unless I initiate contact and it all seams fake. I want to bond with people. People leave me in mid conversion, even thought I honestly pay attention to what they say. People only talk to me because they feel bad. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my 10 year old brother. He sees me as his hero, and I don't want to break his heart.

I went through a pretty bad breakup for the 2nd time this year and again everyone mostly sided or chose to support my ex. 

If this is how people feel about me then I must be a terrible human. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, or feel comfortable in my own skin. There's nothing to distract me from all of these negative thoughts and seeing no one for weeks is making me spiral out of control.

I know I messed up as much as anyone else does but the guilt is eating me and I feel like a burden trying to reach out to others. Some people still say they care about me but they don't make time for me or ever reach out. I'm always the one that has to initiate. It further confirms that I'm just a burden to others. Maybe the world would be a better place without me if I'm so easy to avoid/abandon.

I see people talk about how they’ve given up bad habits like smoking cigarettes or the occasional drink for their children and it makes me feel like such a fucking horrible parent. I can’t give up either. Which are both minuscule compared to how I can’t give up doing meth. Not for my child. Not for my husband. Not for me. I just can’t. I don’t see HOW these other people are able to stay off of drugs after their kid is born. I mean I get it if you know you can’t handle being an addict and still raise a kid. But what if you CAN? What happens when your drug usage becomes equivalent to taking your daily Prozac? What about the people who do drugs to literally just be able to have the energy (mental and physical) to deal with their every day life? Who don’t give a fuck about the routine of it, who don’t get “high” anymore, who don’t use it as a social tool? What happens when you don’t have the time or help to quit because you have to stay home taking care of your daughter and household while your husband is at work? And you both have absolutely NO help from anyone? No stable family or friends on either side?  And then of course when you don’t have drugs how you can barely function. How every second of the day is delayed by moments while your brain scrambles trying to process the most basic things? And then what happens when the drugs aren’t even fucking working anymore? 
I feel like everyone and everything would be so much better off without me. Yeah initially it would suck, but once that wore off I’m sure it’d be clear how much of a complete clustershit my entire existence was. Society would forget about me and my family would be relieved. Relieved that no one would have to watch and worry about the outcome from this endless cycle of turmoil I can’t get out of. That I weigh everyone else down with. I feel like it would be selfish to keep living and inevitably corrupt my daughters thought process with my own fucked up perception of life and way of thinking. And her end up being just like me because “nothing really matters. we all die equal anyways.” And if I did myself in now it would hurt a little less because she probably wouldn’t remember me anyways."

Not because I got better but just that I really just didnt see the point in it anymore and it wasn't enough to make me feel better. Something is always going wrong, I think my downfall began when I got cheated on. I love very strongly and (used to be) very sensitive. I remember I couldn't eat and I would take sleeping pills during the day so that I didnt have to be awake. On my 18th birthday my best friend had to console me because I was begging them to let me go so I could end my life. This was probably really traumatic for them as I was literally screaming and crying. If they weren't there that day I would have gotten the train to a really big bridge near me that I'd be researching suicide rates on. 

I'm 20 now and its only gotten worse. I'm always thinking of how I would do it, which methods are more effective. I guess I just dont enjoy living. I am stressed all the time. A lot of financial issues. You can't really make time to enjoy life when you can't afford it so that doesn't help. I've got quite severe social anxiety so working is hard. Therapy doesn't work on me either because therapists can't just fix your financial issues.

I just finished my first year at university. It started of okay for the first few months. I'm on a very male dominated course in a not very female friendly industry but I knew the risks. I figured it would be fine. My flatmate is a girl on the course aswell so I felt happier. It started off quiet, but 2 of the guys said they thought I was cool and wanted to be friends so I was like sure. I go to uni very far from home, I have no friends there. I thought it would be important to take this opportunity to meet people. 

They ended up sexually harrassing (sharing pictures around) and gaslighting me after I denied their advances (its a really long and complicated story)

My last boyfriend physically couldn't tell me I was pretty. I have never had a boyfriend who is able to compliment me and it's really shaken my confidence to a new low. I know I'm not model material.

my next psychiatrist visit is late december, and i'm already low on meds (saw her in january last time). if i'll run out before that time, i WILL self-immolate in front of my country's ministry of health. i am not joking. i'm done with this hell. i'm done with the way the mental health system is shat on at every single occasion. maybe these bastards will finally get to work. or declare me insane therefore nothing i have to say is of any importance.
i just don't want to leave my little brother alone here. i'm crying as i'm typing this, but i can see that i'm an authority to him and his best friend. he's just a kid. i help him out in videogames, we play a lot of them together, in computer stuff. i don't want to do this to him.
i feel like there just isn't any help for me. i have brief moments where i can ignore all the hell that's happening, but otherwise, life doesn't feel worth living, knowing that i'll probably won't even reach my 40s because of how unlivable the planet will get.
i'm utterly powerless, and i'm this close to just turning to drugs."

1865,Anniversary of ex’s death,w1p3uo,Lyssdidit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w1p3uo/anniversary_of_exs_death/,1,SuicideWatch,False,"So, on July 19th will be 4 years since she OD’d next to me while I was asleep (unconscious from my own drug use).

Been 2 years and 9 months since I used heroin/coke. About 8 months since smoked weed. 81 days since I last had drank alcohol, and about as long since having a cigarette (vape still at very low mg).

Just thinking and don’t know if I can make it this year without doing something dumb…

I’m trying not to relapse, but I always do because it’s better alternative to killing myself.

This day 4 years ago I should of died with her, we swore to a suicide pact. I tried, but I blacked out during my attempt at overdosing.

Like I usually end up drunk and telling myself I’m not an alcoholic, maybe I’m not, because I eventually want more, eventually crave something illegal.

I’m stable, but I’m cracking, falling apart and acting like I’m not. May not happen this week, but normally by summers end I fuck up. 

I have supports, people I can go sit in their room and relax with. I’m overworked, overwhelmed, I’m not doing meetings as I should be. I try, but get too busy, someone decides they need to talk to me right then, or I’m so exhausted I fall asleep.

I’m working 5 days when only supposed to work 4, where my sleep schedule is wake up at 4am, get in cab at 5:20 for work at 6, get out at 2pm if I’m lucky, take bus home to arrive there at 3. Shower, make food, attempt some kind of relaxing fun, and sleep by 8pm.

I don’t work Monday’s but I do all my doctors and therapies that day. Which honestly only gives me Sunday as a day to really relax, but no buses, so I have to depend on walking or friends to take me places.

It’s just a lot, I would do weed, but I’m in sober housing that doesn’t allow it… I have severe ptsd other than my ex’s overdose. It’s only thing that’s truly helped me in the past.

I don’t even know why I’m typing this, just tired. I’m not even depressed. Not really suicidal. I’m suffering in silence though.

I don’t know what to expect, because could be as simple as bringing a knife into the shower and self harming again… because can’t drug test for that.

*exhales*

If read all that, thanks. I know what not to do. A psych unit can’t help, not a chemical imbalance, all mental, it’s trauma, need my therapist and friends. 

I don’t want to crack, but if I do I want it to be in a safe space with friends or healthcare professionals.

Well, I’m just gonna go, respond if ya want to"

I want to make everyone as happy as I possibly can and do my best to keep them all from suffering, but they ultimately have the power over these things, I don’t. I’m not saying this because I want to control everything and everyone. I’m saying this because they likely either don’t realize the power they have over me and everything I have ever done, or they genuinely hate me for liking them while still demanding emotional security and validation from them. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I’m not trying to take anything away from them. I want to be the best thing that’s ever happened to them so it would benefit THEM in addition to me. I’m tired of them all keeping me a failure. I’m trying to be as happy as I can but it’s extremely fucking painful losing parts of my core self. It shouldn’t be a bad thing that I’m so attached to them and their stuff that I actively draw and include them in ideas of my own, and that I want to work alongside them. I want to be part of the fun they’re excluding me from, and I think that if they included me and were more friendly towards me, I would feel good enough about myself that they would start feeling good with me.

However, I do feel like my time on this earth is done and that I’m just still here for pointless reasons. This world is just revolved around money…so working until you’re basically dead, high expectations from jobs on low wage (if you want higher, it’ll be more stress and more expectations, yet to get taxed a lot more). Losing people - losing the ones you love. War. Inflations. Competition. Comparison. Not feeling good enough or enough. Rudeness/judgements. No true love, even then that’s scary. The way this society treats elderly people, is just scary. Because, I work in housing, I do see/hear alot of unfairness. 
It all just sucks. 

I’m soon to be 23 which is next week. And I think it’s better for me to end it now, I feel like I’ve lived enough…Seen enough, Idk what else is left.

I don’t know why he felt unsafe around me, I never meant to make anyone feel that way, but he said he didn’t feel emotionally safe around me or trust me almost from the beginning. 

He wasn’t v loving with me and never expressed his feelings, he lied to me about a lot of things and flirted w other girls a bunch. He said he’s not like that usually and only did all that stuff bc he was in a really bad emotional state and was constantly wondering whether there was someone who would treat him better bc he hated the way I treated him. I don’t understand at all bc to me I was putting in so so so so much effort to make him feel special and loved and I did get upset but it was after I tried so hard and felt like I wasn’t getting back even a fraction of what I was putting in. I felt like I put in so much effort and none of it even mattered bc he didn’t feel loved or cared for. 

I spent years of my life just wanting him to love me back the way I knew he was capable of, all I got was lied to. All I got was fights and blame for the fights. Now he says it’s easy for him to love someone else the way I always wanted him to love me. He didn’t say any of this with malice either, he was just being genuine and open about where he is in life right now

Fuck me. I don’t know what is wrong w me that I make people feel unsafe. I don’t know why I’m so hard to love. I want to die, I really really want to die.

I don’t want anything bad to happen to her, but “she’s never guilty” or does anything to help 

I hate myself for caring about my mother
I despise being near my mother

I hate wanting to go home just to make things easier for my father

I don't have the self esteem to fix myself or delude myself into thoughts of being okay. I live off of distractions. Distractions to avoid thinking about how much of a burden I am. How I always feel like I hold people back or leech off of them like a parasite.

How nice it would've been to actually have met my end those years ago. It's been a while since things have been this heavy. The temptation and the knowledge that it would hurt but then it'd be over. Not just for me but for the people I burden.

This ball of fear and uncertainty in my chest feels suffocating and I don't know what to do about it. I don't think I can do anything about it. Right now it's too strong to tune out. My heart hurts. It's just a waiting game I guess and I'm in the bottom of an active hourglass. Except that hour glass is going to be... weeks? Months?

Old temptations have come back too. Wriggling thoughts of ways to cope with the pain. I might just give in because I am tired. I am exhausted and I need some sort of release.

Idk why I'm typing this. Just screaming into the void. It's never helped before and doesn't help now. I think it's always been one of those last resort things. Putting down a piece of myself into some overly dramatic format worthy of a teenage angst that never left. 

There is no plan, but if terminal sickness were to strike would I really care? Hard to say. My head is too full of other hypotheticals to bother ruminating over another one. 

It's just really fucking hard. I don't know how people are able to do this life thing. I guess there is the path of autonomy. A robotic schedule to follow out with no deviation, no adventure, just safety. But is that really living in the end?

I posted something here,a cry for help,and,two day ago when i reinstalled back reddit,i saw that i had a dm,and it was someone reaching out to me,saying hey um i saw your suicidal post and just hang on there its gonna get better,he then proceeded to say : i hope your still alive.so,today,after one year,i answered him this :

Hello,happy to see that back then there was hope in humanity,fortunately i am.as you can tell,therefore,i did hang on,after receiving dm recommending me to see a therapist and multiple person being worried about me without even being close,i did in fact consider seeing someone,which i ended up doing,its been what,about 1 year,and i achieved to over come this dark,painful,and overwhelming beast.seeing someone made me realize that,for a lot of reason,suicide shouldnt be a thing,but,regretful as it is,its a common thing in our society,as much common to the point where we reduce the importance,the impact,of talking to someone.if i had made a joke like : i wanna die,back then i would have got thing like: are you ok? Do you want me to call someone?or people would recommend therapist,now,when someone say those types of joke,we get : « same » or « relatable ».two years ago,when my bf killed himself,if you had told me that now 17/7/22 i would be alive and doing what i love for hobby and work,which is art (long story short i work for « special » type of art in certain « special » Japanese show,which is not anime but the other « anime ») if you told my two years ago me that rn,id be making video,photography,poem,music,and all the thing i do rn,i wouldn’t have believed you,i would have probably laugh at you,as sad as i was.but,i decided to hang on,and,by that,i discovered way more than : internet,mean comment,bully,and unbased society standard ,I discovered drawing,poetry,literature.idk if it’ll look and seem selfish,but,back then i thought that it couldn’t get better,but i decided to be the change i expected.and it worked,and let me tell you,it didnt work at the first try,no,getting better is a long processus

So the thing here is,if me,someone completely random on the internet,a teenager,who lost his parent at a young age and had other traumatic experiences,i think you can do it too,and no,dont feel bad if you didn’t achieved to get better its ok,it doesn’t always work the first time,it might take time,and being alright is like a stair,its not going to be straight up ok,its gonna take time,and slowly but surely,youll see bright.

On that note,love y’all and my dm are always open folks💙✨"

I have ADHD, and I'm on the ASD spectrum, but I cannot explain these feelings. I live with a generally high baseline of anxiety, but it has gotten to the point where I feel like I need to hospitalize myself so that someone can monitor me. Yesterday, my paranoia reached a crisis point: I had made a genuine plan to kill myself, but drove myself to the hospital parking lot and stayed there until my best friend and my girlfriend calmed me down and made me feel safe enough to go home.

Today, I'm forgetting when I'm falling asleep and waking up, I'm hitting/slapping/punching myself in the head and face, and I feel like my head is about to explode. I don't know if I am experiencing an episode of psychosis, and I have incredible health insurance, but I cannot actually go and be admitted to a hospital solely because I'm currently COVID-19 positive, from a PCR test on Friday and a rapid test today, after exposure last Sunday.  The thoughts of suicide are still there, but with added paranoia.

I do not know what to do. I feel like I need to be observed and monitored so I do not hurt myself (I do not have nor have I ever had any desire to hurt others), but I feel like this is impossible given my positive COVID-19 diagnosis. What should I do?"

To add icing to the cake my homophobic parents found out about it (my mother snooped around on my laptop) they then proceeded to yell at me and gaslight me with ""love the sinner hate the sin bullshit"" and called me every slur in the book. Eventually I caved in and even believed I could be straight, they promptly sent me to religious counselling, his cold readings were impressive however he did not ""pray away my gayness"" I subsequently got cut off from all social media and got my phone smashed. My mental health shattered and I've felt unstable since that day, eventually i started using my old phone and still devestated by having to end the relationship with my ex I tried to socialise on discord. I (16m) met another guy (14m)
We talked about how we both got abused by our shitty parents and somehow it evolved into flirting. He kept pushing for more however i stated that I wasn't comfortable with it even though he would be 15 the next month. He proceeded to send a thigh pic which I found slightly disturbing. We texted back and forth and my mom once again found out that i was texting another dude so the whole ordeal happened again and basically they say I'm mentally ill, however they believe Qanon conspiracy theories so the double standard is quite big. My mom found suicidal videos on my YouTube and said she was the one who should kill herself. In regards to the second situation I feel like I'm guilty because I was called a pervert and a pig by my father. Childhood abuse goes much farther back but i don't have the space to write it all. Give me a reason not to end myself."

I have gotten to the point where all I see in my life is pain and disappointment. I feel alone and that I have no one to turn to. I recently got kicked out of my parents house for being too depressed, my parents yelled me that they are being affected by my depression and that I need to get over whatever is going on in my life and just be happy. 

I am depressed for a lot of reasons but the main one is my anosmia. I lost my sense of smell and taste in 6th grade. after I got hit by a truck on my bike. I can’t remember what anything taste/smells like and it constantly makes me feel like I am missing something in my life. I will never get my senses back. 

I got sexually assaulted my a childhood friend at a prom after party. I am a male and the person was female. It’s not easy for me to admit that to people in my life because they don’t understand why I’m so upset. My parents told me to just get over it. This isn’t my fist time having to go through an assault. I have  an older cousin who used to take picture of me naked, sneak into my bed while I slept and molest me. I have worked very hard to get through this but all through middle school and part of high-school I had “friends” who would make fun of me. I knew someone who sexualized me over my trauma. I was very depressed in high school.

There is more I am holding onto; my brother defending an ex-friend for breaking into his ex’s house and saying  that he was going to bring a gun next time. My parents denying that I have depression and just telling me to just get over it.

I don’t want to live anymore, I’m tired of pretending like I have a purpose of a desire to be in this world anymore. I feel like my life has been a constant struggle and I am tired of waking up to it. I am going to try to admit myself to a mental hospital. I am afraid I am going to hurt myself. 

This is my first post ever, I’m sorry if this was hard to read. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to feel better, I am trying to get help."

It hasn’t been til a month or two ago I realized how miserable I’ve been feeling the past 2 years. & yes I understand many in this sub and elsewhere have it much worse than I do but I still can’t help but feel terrible almost everyday. I’m not looking for pity points or advice I just want to get my thoughts out there.

It’s been since September 2020 I think I was actually somewhat happy even though looking back on that time I was having a multitude of problems with my drug addiction & self sabotaging behaviors in my relationship at the time. It took me until this year to realize I’ve been distracting myself with everything possible to quell the feeling and realization that i am alone as far as love life goes.

I had this girl that I could count on for anything in this world and I would give anything to have her back with me. We broke up because I overall was a terrible boyfriend, emotionally unstable and had a real bad drug addiction, opiates , benzos, alcohol, heroin, weed etc.

Today I am 299 days clean from all those drugs (partially due to the fact if I relapse while on drug court I could go to prison for 7 years) but I have been using nitrous oxide almost every week to get high because in reality I truly miss the feeling drugs used to give me even tho I got locked up behind them and during my time incarcerated I lost the love of my life to my so called best friend at the time who now has a baby with said girl. The way everything played out gave me an extreme case of depression and self confidence issues, I felt betrayal like I never have before & it’s been almost 2 years now and I still think about it/her everyday. 

I know I was a bad lover in the sense I didn’t live up to my full potential for this woman because now if I could have her back or start all over the whole thing would be a completely different story. 

I’ve been distracting myself lately with multiple women who I know damn well I would never enter a real relationship with , since breaking up with my ex I went from having only slept with 7 or 8 women  including her to 21 in the span of 2021, so, I just want none of these girls , some I know from real life some I meet on tinder or similar sites, (I have deleted tinder now) I have just been distracting myself with sex and fake love with these women, like last night I spent the night with a girl I thought I would actually want to date , but that turned out to be a mess, we still hang out and cuddle and kiss here and there but I was just staring at her asleep on my bed pretending and wishing that she was my ex, cuddling up closer to her and just imagining, it’s fucked up I know.

I just feel like life is beginning to be too much , all I do is sleep all day, work all night (11pm-9am) Monday thru Saturday at ups and distract myself. Thanks for being here this sub I would write more but my phone is lagging while I type this and its pissin me off"

She has been in a very depressive state and she started isolating herself months before already like february because she had to learn for her final exams which were this month.(Plot twist, her dog passed 2 weeks prior and she didnt pass the exam so she didnt get her degree but she only needs to do an internship for a year and then she would get the second highest school degree in germany which also allows her to study in universitys)

I supported her as good as possible and functioned as her backbone I told her all these options and solutions she still has and that everything will be alright she just has to let go or else she wouldnt see all these other opportunities infront of her eventhough she was treating me not nice in those phases since February. She took on some weight and always talks about it which I told her is not a problem for me but it makes her extremely uncomfortable. I gave her the option to support her with doing exercises together so she would gain a routine but she declined. I also gave her the opportunity to do her internship at my stepdads company and she wouldnt have to work just until she finds something else that’s productive and fun for her.(Plot twist she declined the offer and a week later she started bitching about how hard and stressfull it is to find an internship now within a month…?)

Now 4 days prior from this post we met and I was so happy to finally see her again. Little did I know she got me fkd up. She literally came to tell me she wants to break up since she doesnt wanna drag me down with her and her depressed state, i sad that makes literally no sense since she needs me now the most. We are a team. I will love and support her always. But she didnt have the same opinion. So we split. She was supposed to bring me my stuff the following day. She didnt cuz she was ,,too busy“. Now I was visiting my mom for the past 2 days and i got my ex gf some stuff from my moms garden. I texted her if she was available at around midnight so I would drive down to give her the veggies and fruits before they dry out and take my stuff. She read my messages 3 hours later (30min before midnight and didnt respond) i double trxted wow, just to get the response,,ohh sorry im at my friends place in another town“  I made some researches on social media and she was outside all the time enjoying herself with friends and what hurts me the most is we only met 7 times since april because she was always ,,too busy“ but as it seems not for her frriends.
I responded fk it u can keep my stuff and she hasnt responded since that.(1day ago)

Im fueled with so much anger betrayal and hatred. How can u treat someone/ the only one thats been so caring to you like shit. Make it make sense.

I wanna make her suffer right now. And my emotions are leadng me to do things that may drive her to hurt herself or worse. I dont really wanna go that path, but what did I spend my time, money and love for in these 3 years?…

I just want the option to opt out anytime and it angers me that I'm denied even this opportunity where I live. One of my comforts in life is thinking about how I could plan a trip to a place where suicide is an option for even healthy adults. Otherwise, the more effective and painless drugs here are illegal, and failed suicide gets you in a mental ward or a hospital possibly for the rest of life. Not to mention the social stigma.

I want to remain a fully functional autonomous being, anything other than that is less welcome than death. And every day I continue to live I live with the fear that the life I want would be taken from me and am plagued with thoughts of all the horrible ways I could die. I'm from a country where merely being a citizen and expressing opinions could get you ""vanished from society"" if you happened to travel to the wrong place. Even if that threat weren't there, the climate is getting worse with every year; pollution is nonstop; newer, more lethal and more precise weapons are being developed; so much personal information tracking and monitoring that no one can be invisible, no one can ever be free. it just feels like the future is going to be a terrifying place to live in and with each day I survive I regret that I hadn't killed myself earlier.

No one around me takes my concerns seriously, or if they do, they could do nothing about it other than repeat the useless and often guilt-tripping sentiment that we should nevertheless strive, that there are many people less fortunate than us etc, as if I didn't already know that. Whatever direction the world is heading, I don't want any part of it. Maybe it still doesn't look as bad right now, but one day it will all go downhill, and is it so wrong to want to choose a time to die painlessly with what human dignity I have left as an alternative to a foreseeable painful demise?"

I have been unemployed since 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Before the pandemic I was a confident, professional and well educated individual. I was working in luxury sales on good commission while I finished my medicine degree. I have a degree now but there are some issues that can’t be helped it seems. Years ago I had agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder to the point I couldn’t speak to family members. This was treated with medication and years of counselling. Then during lockdown all of these issues came back but I couldn’t get treatment for it and the medication didn’t have the same effect. I have applied for jobs that are minimum wage despite having a medical degree but when I go to interviews I basically make a fool of myself tripping over my own words, stuttering, speaking too quickly and not giving enough information. So I get numerous rejections. Because I haven’t had success with the medication again like I did years ago I can’t go on. I have zero friends so I have no means to socialise. The last time I was able to socialise outside the house was on a work night out years ago.

Now I am just defeated I have tried for 2 years to get back into it, but I have found this to be a catch 22 situation that is impossible to break out of. As well as other issues in my life with dating as a result of my illness that have contributed greatly to my depression. People on dating apps constantly tell me that I am handsome and I get invited to many dates but due to the fear of leaving my home and the shyness when on dates it always ends with me getting even more depressed a few days later when I am told that they don’t want to see me again because I am “too shy” or I have been told that my shyness made me seem uninterested but that wasn’t the case.

&#x200B;

I don’t see any other way out now, I am in debt which has made me more depressed, I can’t get a job or leave my home. I have no friends to hang out with or even speak to online. This isn’t how a man in his mid 20s is supposed to live I feel, I always thought I would be in a professional job starting a family at around this time in my life, but instead I have no life. So now I see no point in having my life anymore. As such I have already made a big decision. I just feel like I had to vent a little on here first. Be good to each other."

I’m your typical high school 4.0 overachiever student that does well in both in and outside of school. Not many people think about me and how much I struggled. I put up a good face. Earned many recognitions at school, looked highly upon by other students and teachers, until my first attempt. That unfortunately failed as I tried to OD on some prescriptions I had. I then had another attempt sometime this summer which no-one knows about and also ODed. Had some bad side effects, but I’m still here. 

Over the past years of my life I’ve faced emotional and physical abuse from when I was younger. I also had an unfortunate encounter with a family friend when I was young. I was raped. It was taken away from me and to this day, I can’t seem to cope well enough. Over the past few months I’ve felt like crap. Some things had happened at school and it tugged on my self esteem and confidence. My relationship with my family sucks. I barely talk to them either. My therapist as well isn’t helping because I don’t trust him at all. Sometime in August will be my last day. I live in a 12-story building which will make things easier to access. I have my letter written, but also have some specific people I want to write separate letters for. I’m highly religious and faithful—Christian Baptist. I’m sorry God, but I feel like I’ve failed everyone.

I’m sorry if this triggers anyone."

Last year I was inpatient for a while, changed a few things in my life that put me down and it helped. It really did.
And the last week or two, every night I lay awake in bed besides the best person in the world and I just can't stop thinking about how I could do it, what would be quick, how could I avoid being found by my SO, etc.
I know I need help, I want to get help, I know I probably need to go back inpatient and then stay in therapy for a while.
But I am so so afraid that my SO won't go through this with me again. He put himself under a lot of stress the last months to help me change my life, and he doesn't deserve me breaking down. AGAIN.
But if I go through with my fantasies I'll leave him alone and broken forever.

1960,"I Emotionally Abused My Girlfriend at 18, I've Received Minimal Consequences, and The Guilt Is Consuming Me",w12863,NotAVeryGoodSandwich,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w12863/i_emotionally_abused_my_girlfriend_at_18_ive/,9,SuicideWatch,False,"At 18 years old, I entered my very first relationship. Throughout my life I always considered myself as someone who was raised to be kind and considerate of others. Most of my friends were women, I heard a lot of women's perspectives, I had a very hardset moral compass, and I thought I had done a decent job of acknowledging toxic or abusive behaviors and learning what not to be as an adult. 

However, this first relationship didn't take long to turn toxic. Despite our friends telling us that they thought we were the spitting image of a healthy relationship, things turned south very quickly. We were extremely co-dependent, to a massive fault, and the relationship turned sexual far sooner than I thought it would. We had early talks about sex and both said we were not too keen on having it super soon. However, we were dumb teenagers and spent a lot of time making out and going on midnight drives to have long talks in the car. We then began having sex nearly every time we hung out. We were clearly starting to get extremely attached, and I myself was developing very bad attachment issues. When problems arose in our relationship, or when she did something that made me upset, I became very guilt trippy. I expected her to instantly know what I was upset about, and a lot of the time I expected her to take responsibility for it. I became super self-pitying and extremely passive aggressive when something came up that made me feel insecure or left out or if I was worried about her or didn't think she was making the right choice. I guilt tripped her for telling me she wanted to try drinking and smoking, 2 things we both had never really done because we were very prude about them. I guilt tripped her once for leaving a call to masterbate because I was insecure she didn't want to sext with me, instead of simply respecting that she didn't want to sext and that being the end of it. I guilt tripped her when she started to blow off our plans to hang out for someone else, whether our plans were alone or with our friends, and when she apologized I would never stop there. I would drag arguments on for far too long and harp on the same talking points over and over again, especially over text, and I always felt the need to dump my emotions on her when I was sad. Toward the end of our relationship especially, she received numerous WALLS of text after text after text telling her how I felt and all the things she had done wrong. If she wasn't available for me to vent to, I would become resentful and tell her that it made me upset and I thought she was being really mean and ignoring my feelings. At a certain point I even began to tell her I thought she was being abusive, as this is what I genuinely thought, and I told her I thought she really needed help for her mental illness because I thought her depression was hurting our relationship and was hurting her as well. This obviously wasn't the reason our relationship was failing, and it obviously was incredibly hurtful and damaging to blame my own behavior and mental health issues on someone else's mental health issues. I know many people say that this is just a tactic abusers use to ""flip the script"", but I would genuinely look online at articles about emotional abuse in order to reaffirm my suspicion that her behaviors were abusive. I don't know what made me feel this way, but I genuinely thought - on my own, and with other people out of the picture - that I was being abused, and that things were just really complicated and back-and-forth. To this day, I still don't know exactly what was happening and I am ashamed and legitimately mortified that I cannot recall all the memories in order to see how I behaved and understand the situation fully. After a period of deep depression and healing (just from the breakup, not implying that I was abused), I spent the next 4 years just living my life before the memories all came flooding back this past week, and it has genuinely blind-sided me and dramatically changed the way I view life in a complete and total 180. I think part of the reason I pushed away the idea of me being an abuser was because I was so deeply horrified by the possibility, another part of it had to do with my lack of objectivity or my ability to see things from an outside lens, and another part of it was my OCD... which caused a lot of dissociation, internalized shame and guilt, and ""protagonist syndrome"" feelings that I could somehow fix the whole world or everything around me just by proving my own free will and doing it.


I never want to say ""look how much I've changed!"" because that is not right and not what I'm trying to get at, nor does it at all change the fact that I deeply hurt someone and affected her psychologically in a way that can take years and years to heal from. I hurt her close relationships and I hurt her self-esteem. I hurt her sexual expression and I hurt her idea of what a healthy relationship and healthy conflict resolution actually look like. I only pray that I did not begin a cycle of emotional or sexual abuse that will last on and on for years. I am merely saying that I have lived my life thinking things were ""toxic"" or ""complicated"", and I think I pushed a lot of the truth out of my mind when she broke up with me, and it feels like I am re-litigating the past all over again. I was the liar, and I was the one who distorted the truth, that entire time. It was incredibly beyond wrong of me to tell my friends or family anything other than that, no matter the reason. I lacked objectivity during a time where I absolutely needed to zoom out and see the situation for what it was, and I failed to learn from it properly. I believe I have learned a lot in the past 4 years, but I do not believe I have even remotely begun holding myself accountable, and I am horrified by the fact that others were forced to decipher what was going on and condemn my behavior. I am horrified that I did not listen when she told me in black and white how it felt and what it was like being forced to listen to me harp on and on about the same problems that she didn't deserve to hear about. 


After a long time of not talking to, contacting, or thinking about her, I eventually realized she still had my belongings at her house. I asked for them back at one point but did not receive a proper response from her friend who I contacted, and I remember telling the friend I would have to ask the police to get them back if they didn't deliver them to me. Because I did not understand the weight of my actions and the sensitivity of those things I asked them to hand over to me (they were obviously sentimental), this ended up being an extension of my abuse because I made her relive part of that relationship at a seemingly random time. I actually messaged her in summer of 2020 with a very poorly worded message attempting to see if we could talk about our memories, as a lot of people I knew had come forward in a #metoo-esque movement and I told her I wanted to be held accountable for anything that I did but did not understand or did not remember, but the message again seemed to pin the blame on both of us instead of taking accountability for what I had done. She proceeded to say that it all felt like a blur, she told me she forgave me for anything and everything that happened, and she said she was making peace with it and she hoped that I can make peace with it as well. She said she wanted her response to be the end of the conversation, so I have not responded or spoken to her since then and I think that's obviously for the better. I am confused even further by her response and I feel helpless knowing that I may never know the full extent to which I hurt her or the full extent to which I violated another person's trust or self-worth. 


I do not have a plan to commit. Currently, I have a plan to attempt to begin taking accountability for my past behaviors and the way that I have acted since we broke up in 2018. I have a plan to see a new therapist (I used to go to therapy, but stopped, and then had trouble getting started again) and specifically tackle the issue of my abusive behavior in that relationship, as well as the extension of my abuse for long after the relationship ended. I will also be tackling the extent of my abusive behaviors toward other people in my life and repenting for the way that I had acted... even if the behaviors do not qualify as abuse, I still am horrified that my desire to manipulate situations and feel control over my life has hurt the people I love at any point in time, especially when those people were helping me. I still am horrified that I lied or distorted the truth when telling the people I love about what happened. Even if I painted her as a good person and said things were complicated, I insinuated that she was lying when all she did was tell her story to some friends, and I caught wind of it and preemptively posted something on my Facebook and talked to a few friends just to tell them that I didn't think it was true. Since our relationship ended, I also have lost my license due to reckless and aggressive driving that could've hurt or even killed people, and I have become a toxic gamer when I am playing games online, which I recognize has bothered a lot of the people I've played with even if it's only in small ways, and I recognize that both of those behaviors may have been a result of the paranoia I constantly experience due to my mental illness, as well as the desire to have control over my life and control over the situation which turns me into a bully. I still have a lot I need to understand about our relationship and fully put into context before I can really wrap my head around everything that happened and why and how, and I am committed to understanding and taking as much accountability as is humanly possible over the situation. 


But I currently wonder if people like me deserve to live (whether or not ""deserve"" is the right word), or if our present and future will forever be an insult to the survivor because of the choices we made in the past. I wonder if there is any reason to live, at least after the point where I have fully apologized to my friends and family and given my ex-girlfriend as much opportunity as I possibly can to get some peace of mind, a space to come forward if she so chooses, some more faith in her own memories and less reason to doubt herself, etc. I have been reading a lot about what motivates the actions of people like myself during that relationship, and a lot of people seem to say that abusers tend to have experienced some sort of trauma in the past, so I know it makes no sense to grade my existence on a scale and decide if I deserve to live more or less than any other person on this planet who has done something so heinous and destructive. I know it also makes no sense to compare my suicidal thoughts to those of a completely innocent person who HASN'T committed any form of abuse or assault. But nevertheless, I feel the weight of the possibility that ANYONE on this earth truly believes - in good faith - that I do not deserve to live, and that haunts me and probably will continue to haunt me for the rest of my life, obviously in addition to the fear that people I cared deeply about have been hurt beyond repair.

If anyone can relate to this post in any way at all, I would like to hear what your experience has been and how you have coped with the guilt of doing something so incredibly horrifying and disturbing that it consumed your entire life, and the guilt of becoming someone angry and resentful and toxic. Please note that I do not want to hear excuses or denial from other abusers, please. I still wish to live, if only to see this through and not cause any harm to the people I love, and to do as much good for the world as I possibly can. I'm also afraid to leave and I love my sister, my father, and my friends more than anything in the world, but I think that is obvious and I would like to not be selfish about my reasoning. Thank you if you have read this far."

1963,Humanizing/Giving a Personality to People Who Die by Suicide👼,w0xg25,Glittering_Adagio758,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w0xg25/humanizinggiving_a_personality_to_people_who_die/,27,SuicideWatch,False,"I never liked the phrase suicide is selfish like they didn't have a name, favorite jokes, favorite food, childhood pet, music they enjoyed. When a cancer survivor no longer wants to fight, usually people commend them for their valiant fight and remember them, regard and, honor them. Sometimes vigils with candles and songs sometimes just the family gathering together. Not always, some cancer survivors are sadly mistreated for not wanting to suffer anymore. So I'm not saying one is better than the other. It's horrible either way.

But I noticed when we talk about suicide and society it's like oh they were selfish and then like that's it. I saw an article of a young lady who passed away by suicide around the age of 18 and all the article was about was her being basically selfish and it being unexpected nothing about her personality. Nothing about who she was.

Friends of mine that crossed over👼 to a better life and a better world they were not selfish and I hate how their entire life is reduced being selfish over ending their pain. They should have stayed alive for other people, well that was selfish, well no one saw it coming but the thing is people don't listen. They don't want to listen to people and about their suffering. They want them to mask it and lie about it because it's an inconvenience and nobody wants to hear it but then when people decide to take the choice to no longer be here than all of a sudden no no you're selfish. From fake people.

I don't like it. I hated how people would say to me oh well you know they should have stayed alive because if you guys it's selfish that they ended their life and I mean this society drills it into our heads that it is selfish so I can't blame people for not knowing what to say.

But why don't we ever say human things? Like oh they must have been tired. Is there anything I can do for you? Can I bake you a casserole or a hot dish in some regions? Do you want me to bring my dog over for your dogs playdate and we can watch movies?

Why don't we ever say things like they must have fought valently, but they must have been tired. Or a simple my condolences or who were they as a person? I mean just normal things you would say to grieving people. Is there anything I can do for you? What were they like? It's just they were selfish and it's not just me that goes through this, but like my entire friend group and communities I'm in.

The one thing people draw from suicide is selfishness. They don't see the suffering they don't see the pain because they don't want to. I guess maybe it's a coping mechanism for some people. But my friends had names. They had jokes, they always made me laugh and always protected me. They were good people. Not a selfish bone in their body and even if they were it's their business. They had favorite foods and like I feel like all of that just gets forgotten.

It's not my friends crossing over to peace that annoys me, but people acting like folks are selfish while participating in a society that promotes suffering. My friend's choices are their own but I can guarantee you in most of my friends cases that if we had been in a society that's not as fake and as tiring as this they might have lived a little longer.

we brush under the rug the corruption of psychiatry in some instances, the corruption of medical services, the corruption of foster care and for what? To tell people that they're awful for not wanting to participate in some disgusting game anymore?

People told my friends trauma would get better but it doesn't and that's okay you just learn to work with it. But sometimes you just get tired and you're done. You want to call it quits before you're so mentally inept from suffering that you can't make that decision anymore. People want to act like there's no breaking point and there is and the difference between my friends and I in society is we understand that point. We focus on quality of life over quantity of days or the number of days. We don't brush people's feelings off or force them to go on a medication because they're feeling a certain way because of their trauma. We just listen and it's so refreshing being around my friends. I feel society is so tiring like I don't even participate in it a lot because I don't have the energy to pretend to be a part of something I don't even like.

I wouldn't say I'm miserable. I have a good life for what I've been through and I'm still dealing with a lot but my friends and I we always make each other laugh without being toxic positive.

Take my friend Kade. He was 15. He loved the Vampire Diaries and Taco Bell and photography it's a cute smile but he always had behind the camera. He was shy and one day he had enough of his dad raping him every single night and he took his own life. He told me he was tired and he simply wanted to take a long rest and enjoy Paradise. Was he selfish? When foster care was corrupt when the streets are awful I mean I'm not going to sit here and bash a friend of mine for not wanting to do it anymore.

Do we ever talk about how much strain that is on an adult let alone a child? No obviously I think 15 is Young to take euthanasia he didn't want that he just want to get out of his situation and nobody was doing that for him except us and everyone fought against us to keep him in that situation. And yet people say he's selfish. He's just a kid just say something like oh my God that's so terrible like just act like a human.

Anyway, ran over. This group always inspires some of my thoughts."

She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further"

I posted on AskReddit asking non-depressed people how they felt and I'm shocked. Not sure what I expected though.


You exist in this hellhole and you're just like... Chill with it? Like I'm so happy for these people but it's mindblowing! Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.


Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man."

Not even a, “you don’t seem like yourself today, are you okay/look at this meme”/anything but treating them like an asshole who kicked your dog.

Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. 

I just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?"

So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues."

Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know."

But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?

I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"

1997,I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',lgdpee,plebbitor24601,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lgdpee/i_hate_foggy_brain_syndrome/,3411,depression,False,"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Edit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude."

No matter how busy I make myself, it all seems pointless in the end. What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down.

Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.

I have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories."

Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester.

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be.

When I do things, I don't feel good about it or pleasure. But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something.

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

2028,I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,jz3rhk,Hush_Angel,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jz3rhk/i_24_f_got_dressed_and_did_a_bit_of_my_makeup_to/,2963,depression,False,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so."

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was.

As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all"

We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore"

Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

2110,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",eczhm3,Absalom98,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eczhm3/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_couple_days_ago_my/,2383,depression,False,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."

We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."

Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway."

Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream?

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'.

I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
2216,Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic.,mkx1uq,uhm_i_dont_know,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mkx1uq/just_because_my_depression_started_during_the/,2061,depression,False,"I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order.

But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be.

No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?

Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."

2273,I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,fmfemk,ineedhelp654321,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fmfemk/im_a_13_year_old_boy_who_is_abused_and_need_help/,1888,depression,False,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?"

Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

There is this little person jumping inside me wanting to live, but my brain and heart is just so done."

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.

I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears.

Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs. They get annoyed with me if I don't wear my happy face, but I can not bear to put it on anymore.

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone.

I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this.

2298,I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,e9uflv,,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9uflv/im_tired_of_being_everyones_therapist_when_no_one/,1848,depression,False,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."

 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow."

I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it.

But I grew up in The West so when I go back to where my parents are from I can't even understand the language.  I'm so alone.

I was attacked on the street yesterday.  Punched in the face by some random guy.  He called me a kung fu b*tch then ran away.  No one did anything.  No one cared.

I hate this stupid world. I hate the people. I hate my eyes. I hate how everyone thinks I'm a foreigner or a virus.  I don't belong in the country I was born and raised in.  I don't belong in the country my parents are from.  I don't belong in this world.

I don't belong on this planet.

I don't belong anywhere.

Not in this life.

I hope death is like sleeping so I can dream forever.  I want to float on a cloud up into the sky and just fade into the deep dark black of the void.  I want to be away from all the loud people. I want to be away from all the hurt and loneliness.   I want to be away and dream nice things of love and joy and warmth and laughter and music.

Not this cold and permanently gray world.

The sun doesn't shine for me.  It only burns my eyes and tells me they have marked me as unwanted.

I want to die."

2316,Can someone read this ? It’s my full story,k4lq26,PikaDicc,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k4lq26/can_someone_read_this_its_my_full_story/,1800,depression,False,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life.

I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. 

I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent.

Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.

I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable.

I just don’t want to feel completely alone anymore.

Update:
I never expected so many people to resonate with this. Thanks for all the awards and support on this post. It makes me feel slightly better that I’m not alone in this. I hope everyone had a good Valentine’s Day!"
2387,I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,len5sx,eXoChuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/len5sx/i_know_the_post_will_go_down_here_but_i_have/,1683,depression,False,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

Love used to be my hope, my north star. But in the words of ""Daughters"", LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. And the reason it's disgusting is because it's the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence."

I hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. And I get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I don’t blame them. But goddamn I wish I wasn’t like this.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of.

While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. "
2411,I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,bmt4zr,Jamiddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bmt4zr/i_really_hate_when_people_invalidate_a_depression/,1646,depression,False,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."

They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them."

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. 

I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it.

Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out."

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me."

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay."

 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .

I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin"

2445,25 years old with absolutely no friends,juifes,custardprincess,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/juifes/25_years_old_with_absolutely_no_friends/,1580,depression,False,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.

You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever."

I don’t like working out. I don’t like being fat. I don’t like traveling. I don’t like being at home. 

Life is literally just like an un-fun video game where you have to accumulate as many dollars as possible to spend on rewards you don’t really care about. 

I don’t like seeing my family. I don’t like being away from them either. 

I just don’t want to live any more. My reason for living is only so other people won’t be heartbroken, but everyone knows how depressed I am anyway so maybe they’ll just feel like I’m in a better place.

I’m about to turn 28 and I just feel pretty confident that my best days are behind me.

She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry."

He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest."

We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.

I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do.

People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."

You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester.

But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive"

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is."

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

""theres so much to live for""

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch.

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

I understand there are people out there that have it worse than me, but does that mean I’m not allowed to be depressed or anxious? Can I not express how I feel without someone throwing in a counterargument about another persons struggle? It’s like people assume everything is perfect as long as you’re alive. They only see what they want to see and aren’t comfortable with the ugly truth. I’m so sorry for rambling, but this really pisses me off."

Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.


Edit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day."

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. 
   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !"

I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist."

Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.

To sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).

Oh and the workout part?

Instead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.

All this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.

And the worst is how many act like they care about feelings but they're just virtue signalling, aka 99.9% of reddit."
2596,Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,i0nm3y,poopparticleprincess,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i0nm3y/boyfriend_finally_succeeded_in_taking_his_life/,1371,depression,False,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

2606,My girlfriend died,a46ol5,DHBryen,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a46ol5/my_girlfriend_died/,1358,depression,False,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city.

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever."

I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.

My parents are neglectful and they did me the same way , the first time I knew I hated myself was around 9. How did they fuck up again. Fucking how.

Edit : sorry for ""diagnosing"" him with depression. Im obviously not qualified to do so , I made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as I did and still do, and I am extremely depressed myself so I was pretty much hysterical.

The day before yesterday, I had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me; knocking over dishes and screaming that I ate so much. I locked myself in my room and didn't eat anything the whole day after that.

Today I wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back. I see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way; but the two deadbolts were there. That probably was a surprise to them.

I didn't want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door, so I opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door. There were so many things left unsaid, I wanted to yell at them for more reasons.

2673,I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),l1hote,LateCarrot7356,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l1hote/i_feel_like_i_have_to_at_least_try_to_kill_myself/,1270,depression,False,"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up :)"

Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral.

My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"

He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today.

I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. 

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

Over the word no.

But when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. 

My dad asked me the other day if I still had my “depression”

What the fuck does he think?

Edit: thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I’m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don’t always fully understand where I’m coming from all of the time so it’s nice seeing that I’m not insane over denying someone else. I managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because I’m starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place I don’t want to be.

When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this. I'll come to family gatherings when it's unavoidable, like Christmas, but every time I'm asked to come visit someone (or someone asks me if they can visit) I make up excuses."

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves.

By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can. It may seem impossible but don't be a loser like me and quit right away keep on pushing while you can before it's to late.

Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn’t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?

I have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don’t think anything will help me out. I’m just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom’s sad face and crying."

Edit: Just realised people must think I'm in the USA. Wondered why this post went crazy. Police in my country don't usually carry firearms, and they were genuinely v nice. Just thought it was unnecessary escalation. They offered to take me to hospital. My depressive episodes are sporadic enough that I can be lucid about them after but while I'm in them my mind is v numb and all I can think of is 'why am I here', and I can't answer. So no need to worry folks, thanks for all the responses. Even if I lost my job I know it isn't the end."

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?"

I’m not depressed, I know a lot of people would miss me and I would destroy my parents if I actually tried to do anything. But none of this truly matters sometimes. I feel empty in a way I can’t put into words and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to this - lack of - feeling. I don’t want to actually pursue a career, I don’t feel motivated to do anything, I don’t see myself working as a teacher and actually being happy, but I also don’t see myself working with anything and being happy.
I just want it to stop. I don’t want to exist, to have to follow social rules, to be human. Sometimes I just feel like every action I make is forged and I’m just waking up everyday, putting on a mask or something and pretending I care about the world. I don’t. I think humans are as insignificant as ants, and that’s actually a beautiful thing. We’re bound to fulfill our duties, keep the engine working and then die.
I wish I could just unplug without hurting anyone, just vanish as if I’d never existed.
No one knows about how I feel, ‘cause I’m the only person who truly knows myself. I get everything done, but everything makes me exhausted. It’s like other people have it all figured out and I’m the only one who can’t bare having to do the simplest of tasks.

Came close once or twice.
But I chickened out.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.
Fuck.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried."

I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. 

Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time.

I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks.

I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.

My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college.

I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.

2836,The cancer has spread to my liver,ohhgb6,coladiecola,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ohhgb6/the_cancer_has_spread_to_my_liver/,1099,depression,False,"Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock. You all are so nice and lovely...it definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that I'm allowed to be upset. So thank you, to everyone who has commented or upvoted, these little moments of support help so much sometimes. Thank you."
2837,Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,lsyxvb,Rasta-Grandpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lsyxvb/is_it_worth_waiting_to_see_if_your_life/,1094,depression,True,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. 

Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better”

Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts

No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol.

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness."

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)"

In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

I know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it"

I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "

Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,d0askq,willhumanitysurvive,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d0askq/im_36_and_stuck_in_years_of_misery_depression_is/,1031,depression,False,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks"

It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day.

Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying."

I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."

When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this."

The whole covid thing made it way harder to distract myself as much as I did before, which made me realise how my life really looked like. Is there really a point in living a life, in which I only look to the things that happened in the past, and ignore the present day as well as the future? Is this really what my life have become?"

2936,I don't enjoy being... human,lsb7t3,Evelynblack69,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lsb7t3/i_dont_enjoy_being_human/,996,depression,False,"Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better.

I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree).  I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. 

For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. 

You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job.  And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff.  In my country there is a cult of working your ass off.  If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor.

Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. 

My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). 

I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then: who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? 

I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. 

I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all.     


I just hate being human. Sorry for my English, blah blah, I hope you'll understand everything."

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
2939,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",tc5fpx,circinia,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tc5fpx/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,279,depression,False,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here."

I hate that my friends worry about me. If I just ended it on the date I planned awhile ago there would be nothing to worry about. I have been okay recently but I have been on edge lately. The littlest things tick me off and I do not know how to comprehend these feelings, I hate them. I get angry at such the smallest things and when my friends ask me what's wrong I do not know how to comprehend these feelings to them. They have told me in the past that I am stupid for always wanting to end my life over the smallest things. I have trauma from my past but I feel like it shouldn't even matter since others have had it worse than I have. About a month ago, I started to feel these emotions rise from my body and I hate it, I want to isolate myself until it goes away but my last episode lasted around 6 months and my friends would hate me if I ghosted them for longer than a week. I do love them so much but this feels like it should be my own problem. I play video games to escape the reality of my shitty life but it doesn't help. I am just so tired. I don't want to wake up somedays, I want to finally be at peace. Is it selfish to want to die? Dying would feel so much better than battling these thoughts every single day. I started writing notes to all of my friends and I keep looking at these letter like should I send them? Am I really going to leave this world or am I going to chicken out again? A disconnection between my friends and I has started and it hurts me. I want them to realize that they have a life without me so it would be easier to move on when I am gone. I don't take pics with them for the same reason. I look in the mirror and I don't see myself. I feel disconnected from the person I used to be. I miss her, she was so cool and funny, she smiled a lot more. She was the person I strive to be now. Why do I do this?."

You would think I would have learned this years ago and just avoided everyone. We would all be better off if I didn't stain their lives with my filth.

im just too different from the people in around. i stim too much and my posture is off and my face is resting at “death glare” and i can’t make my voice correct tonally. i always sound mad. and when i try to explain, or try to fit in, i just alienate myself further. i don’t know how to be a normal person.

i can’t take criticism, i take everything personally and blow it out of proportion. i don’t know how to let things roll off. they consume me. “every day she’s here it’s like it’s her first day” when i thought i was progressing at my job? doing really well? i’m gonna think about that for weeks. months. 

i’m so insecure and unhappy. i ruined my relationship (so he’s not around anymore), i have no friends, i have no hobbies, i apparently suck at my job, and im in constant chronic pain. i am so miserable. i have my parents and brothers. that’s it. my only friend lives too far away. nothing is right. nothing makes me happy. i sleep all the time.

My depression is not something I could ever talk to my family about because number 1: they are the cause of 99% of it, and number 2: all past attempts to talk about it have been met by my mom with laughing it off, or trying to one up me saying “you’re so young, you have NOTHING to be depressed about yet. Why aren’t you grateful for what you have?” I’ve written about every single traumatic thing I’ve been through with 100% honesty in that book. Every dark thought. So desperately I want everyone to read it. I want people to know the truth behind who I am and what I deal with. I want to be taken seriously for once. I want people to know what I go through because most everyone knows absolutely nothing about it. It’s like no one knows the real me at all. This diary is the most important thing I own. It’s like proof of my real existence. I just want people to read it. Especially my family.

I am a man and though I am young I have been through some horrific experiences, suffered a great deal emotionally and mentally and have done some very bad things in my life. I have battled with much more than just depression since I was a young teen but I have recently found at least a little patch of sunshine despite everything.

My problem now is that it feels like I've lost a part of who I am, like depression consumed a part of me as I struggled through it and I am completely lost. I have no idea what I want to be doing with myself or even who I want to be as a human being anymore. I feel cold and shut off, almost like I am no longer a part of my own life and like my soul is barely hanging on. I have lost interest in my job, hobbies and have even noticed changes in the way I carry myself and the way I behave. This is all very foreign to me.

Am I ever going to feel like I am a whole and not a half anymore? What do I do now?  If anyone has experienced this before, please help me understand it because I am so lost and confused."

I feel very uncomfortable talking to my family about any of this stuff their advice is pretty terrible. All I want to do is run away, I love to travel and I hate my life where I am.

This is my second (going on 3rd) long term treatment in I'd say 6-7 years. It feels ridiculous at my age.

I've been trying to fight it off, but it's become increasingly obvious that I've reached another low point and it's not going to get better. I'm on 150mg of my medication, so I can't even increase it. We just recently added a beta blocker to my regime which did wonders for the anxiety, but obviously doesn't help the depression.

I know it's hard to treat mental illness, especially when it's chronic and seems to be painfully treatment resistant, but the constant adjusting is killing me. I feel embarrassed going to the doctor and having to say everything has come undone again. Like I've failed or lied or it's always something with me. Especially when I can't really do therapy right now financially (and past experiences it didn't affect me anyway)

Nevertheless my interest in **Ancient Egypt** is providing an antidote to this, as it represents for me *permanence, stability, durability, concreteness*. *Just like a reference point around which the whole universe revolves.* If this interest of mine wanes I know that I will feel like I am floating in emptiness again. Idk why I think Ancient Egypt represents these concepts of permanence, stability, concreteness, etc. for me. 
(It might be because of the magnificent edifices such as pyramids from the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. It might the beauty of ritual of the weighing of the heart against the feather of truth. It might be the authority and divine power of the pharaohs alongside the gods and goddesses they represent on earth and by whom they're inspired. It might be the writing system of hieroglyphics. It might be the symbols such as *djed*, *was sceptre*, *wedjat eye*. It might be the mystery and symbolism of the Ancient Egyptian religion. It might be the wisdom literature/teachings/instructions which is called sebayt. It might be the interesting division of the historical period by the historians  into the periods of prehistoric, early dynastic, Old, Middle, New Kingdoms, and the two intermediate periods. I do not know much other than these superficial things about Ancient Egypt.) 
But, as I said, even this mental concept that I've invented in my mind is unstable, despite me taking it to be stable for a while. Even this perfect concept of the mind is bound to wax and wane, and even disintegrate. Is there more to say about this? Still, my interest is staying, it hasn't disappeared. But the thing is even *mental concepts* which are unbreakable are susceptible to change and a decrease in interest."

I've had depression my whole life but tried managing it with exercise, vitamins, etc. It wasn't until the pandemic hit that things really hit hard. I went through two of the most intense break-ups of my life with people I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with. I also had a recent health scare (blood clots in my lungs that took me to the ER twice).

My co-workers are the only people I interact with (remotely), aside from a few long distance friends. None of my local friends ever check in with me or want to hang out. I've never been in this position before. I feel like a shut-in that nobody wants to be around.

I'm such a failure. I can't even pay my own bills, still don't have a car, barely have any clothes on my back.

Everything was about my brother and sister and I was just the extra troubled piece that came in the set. It’s important to say they got my little
Brother help for all his problems. “But I was dramatic and need to move on.” And than there is the usual crap that comes with poverty. Every time I start doing well life knocks me down. I was in a car accident last year and shattered my leg and it’s completely wrecked. I’m in so much physical and mental pain everyday. I’m tired and can’t do it anymore. I’m failing as a mother because my brain & whatever god there is hate me. I have no support. I’m an orphan and the only family that I do have can’t be bothered to care. About two weeks ago when I was having a moment I told one of them that I was so mad at mom for the choices she made. Why let a man who beat you and your kids still come around. I would pack my kids in the car or on a bus and run. (He beat us pretty badly and their are stacks of restraining orders for the two of them ) and my aunt had the balls to show up at my house and cuss me out. They just want me to show up to family holidays and act like we’re tight and that life is peachy. But when I need help they can’t be found. I just am at the end of my rope. I’m lonely and tired. And the only reason I’m holding on is because of my nuggets. But lately I’m thinking they would much better off with someone else. Because they deserve the whole entire world and I can’t give them anything. I’ve tried medications but the side effects are so horrible. I tried therapy again as an adult. But than my therapist left the practice and just dropped me. I’m just so broken. I thought about going to get into a hospital but I don’t have anyone to care for my 2 kids while I’m away. I just can’t do this anymore. I’m regretting having kids because they strapped with a shitty mom who is going to ruin their lives. They aren’t neglected or anything and I make myself function at the bare minimum for them on the worst days like today.  It my house is always a mess, and I’m a mess and that’s not fair to them."

I was very ill for the last 3 months and couldn't go. Three days ago I started to feel a lot better because of new medication. So I brought up the motivation to inform my boss I could work again today. I wouldn't have to because nobody's expecting me to. But I was so ill that I couldn't even get out of bed most of the time and I developed a strong desire to participate in life again (or better for the first time ever haha). After a few weeks I was more depressed than ever but I personally made a lot of progress in my ways of thinking tbh. I want change that's why I went to see my boss today. Staying home, watching TV, binging on drugs and sleeping, I did that before I got ill. But since I didn't have any other chance then doing these things I realized how toxic they really are and that I definitely don't want to be that kind of person. 

Sooo, what's the problem? I don't know why but as soon as I spoke to my boss I immediately felt shitty because I have to go back in tomorrow. It's draining all my energy just to think of that. It's like before and I don't know what to do. I called in sick very often because of that reason that is also something I want to change obviously. 

But how do I achieve this if I'm going straight back to feeling miserable? How does someone stay motivated or can accept to have to work at least? I don't get it... I even got suicidal thoughts like ""I don't have to work if I'm dead"" and I feel so ridiculous about that!!!

It's the same with every job I ever did. But this time I'm doing what I'm really interested in so it seems very strange to me. Does this mean I'm doomed to feel miserable when have to work because of my depression? How do I get the energy every healthy person seems to have naturally? I'm the only thing holding me back from being successful I know that. But I also don't know how to get the energy needed to change that. 

I'd really appreciate some advice. Sorry for the long text I just wanted to give some context..."

I'm 27 years old, have no college degree, and the majority of my work experience has been customer service. For two years, I worked as a team lead at a retail store that I was good at and recognized for, but since last year I've been trying to do something new for myself and it's all been in vain. 

I empathize with movie characters that are listless and wanderers essentially. Recent examples that come to mind is Jack Nicholson's character in Five Easy Pieces, Ryan Gosling in Blue Valentine, and Tim Heidecker in The Comedy. I talk a lot with people about things that I want to do and I feel excited by it. I've talked about being an electrician, a mason, a carpenter, having a food truck, all kinds of things that I feel are noble and worthwhile pursuits but any time I get offered opportunities, I always turn them down. My problem is I have a lot of interests and think that if I pursue one thing, I'll have to sacrifice multiple other things. 

I suffer from severe self esteem issues, and over analyzing. I'm always comparing myself to my friends who seem to have their shit together. I have a friend who's an engineer, one who's in medical school, another who's a tattoo artist, and another friend who's in cyber security. They're all making decent money but are more importantly doing things that they feel strongly about. I see their ambition and drive and compare it my lack of ambition. With regards to a trade, I feel like if I undertake an apprenticeship, I have to fully commit myself for at least a year before deciding if it's something I truly want to do. Everyone tells me I'd excel at certain things but I have a hard time finding that same confidence. 

I haven't been employed since May. I moved to Portland, OR with my gf beginning of June, and ended up returning home to Denver a few weeks ago due to an argument we had which resulted in my loosing my temper and becoming violently angry. I most likely lost my relationship as well. 

Now I live with my mom and step dad, and my day consists of crawling out of bed around 8am with no clear goal in mind for my day. I won't eat anything till later in the day, and my only exercise consists of taking their dog for a walk. My day consists of feeling restless because I spend too much time on my phone thinking of things I could otherwise be doing. I had a job offer with an electrical company and I will most likely decline it for a lot of the reasons above. I don't know what I can do when I constantly wallow in my own pity and can't find the courage to make things better for myself."

I believe it's a healthy alternative to other more harmful coping mechanisms and believe me: I have my experience with those.

For me what is actually really fun and a new habit I picked up, is sitting behind the piano or with my guitar, playing random tunes and singing about my woes, with sunglasses and an Hawaiian flower necklace on. It makes me laugh, as it helps sprinkle some levity on those dark emotions.

I do admit despite all that happened, I still can keep my sense of humour somewhat, which may be more difficult for some.

You created the building blocks of the universe and then decided to take the hands off approach , I suppose I would have done the same because it sure beats having to listen to  your minions issues, I guess. 

You gave humans the ability to inherit their genetics from their parents which sounds okay until you realize what that means...

You blessed me with my mothers fortitude, reasoning skills and resilience but you cursed me with my fathers depression, anxiety and general stupidly. So you are asking yourself what that does that mean?  Well, it means that I am just smart enough to understand cause and effect and instinctively understand that If I should choose to use drugs or whatever means to make my life barrable it would increase the difficulty of my life by a factor of 100 

Here is the cosmic punch line .  You made me just clever enough and responsible enough so that I wont go the route of my father but rather stick around in what I can only describe as purgatory.   This cycle of self-hate and trying to make things better for me and my wife.  

I am so tired of these 2 diametrically opposed forces pushing me back and forward. You must be laughing your ass off .   I would be doing the same if I was a bit more sadistic. 

I know that only stupid people believe in you , I guess I got that from my father I just wished that you could have made me stupid enough that I could have  just accepted my life or at least be able to do things that would give me temporary relief .

I just need to get the words out somewhere, and I'd rather say it to strangers on the internet and to people who *get it*. 

I've battled depression for over a decade so I've had my fair share of suicidal ideations. That's all they've ever been though. I've never acted on them or caused self harm. I do know how I would do it though, unfortunately. But these are typically the different *kinds* of ideations (from least painful to most) that I have:

• So depressed that I want to end my life for *relief.* Nothing else other than to escape my internal misery. And convincing myself that my loved ones would be fine. They would grieve at first but eventually carry on with their lives. My husband is a catch. It wouldn't be hard to find a great partner after me. Maybe even one who isn't mentally ill like me.

• Depressed enough that I'm not really wanting to live my life, but also not wanting to end it. This one is particularly uncomfortable just because there isn't any idea of relief. Just a feeling of being trapped.

• And lastly, also the newest to the list and current circumstance, being so depressed that I do want to end my life but also realizing that I leave behind debts and financial burdens that my husband can't handle alone, so I feel forced to carry on. This one also feels like a trap.

And if I were being honest, in the past the things that have kept me ""hopeful"" for my life have been some of the dumbest reasons any suicidal person can think of.

i miss you so much buddy, i always thought I'd immediately kill myself if something ever happened to you, but I waited 28 days and im still not better at all. 

i desperately want to sleep and not wake up, i hate this so much. you know when you have a nightmare and you wake up feeling relieved? it's the opposite for me. i wake up from a world you're in, to a world you're not in. it fills me with fear and dread. i want to die so bad. 

my days are short numbered, i can't live without you. i feel horrible without you. i miss you so much, you're my soulmate.

I got told some news that I should be excited and happy about but all I can think about is the bad and how much I hate myself. I feel too far gone I can’t even imagine a life where I’m better. I know I’ll never change my ways no matter what anyone says and that just kills me. I don’t enjoy randomly thinking about my throat being slit but I probably deserve it who fucking knows.

3027,Feeling invalidated in therapy,w3n2nl,sandhya_parimi,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3n2nl/feeling_invalidated_in_therapy/,1,depression,False,"

Today, I was talking to my therapist who I have been seeing for 3 weeks and when we started our session today, I was very tired because I didn't sleep all night.  He asked me what was wrong when I was hyperventilating a bit and when I told I didn't sleep last night, he said ok. He had no follow up on why. He then started talking about schema therapy and the scientific terms within in for the next 45 minutes without a single interaction with me. He did not even check in with how I was feeling before started talking for 45 minutes straight. He also in between talked about how childhood trauma because of invalidating parents cause certain negative schemas and he went on to say , 'unfortunately none of our parents are perfect'. After 45 minutes, he gave me assignments on what to do and was about to wrap up without check with me still , although our session is for 1 hour long. I was initially excited for my therapy to discuss a lot of things but by that time,  I was feeling really sad because of a 45 minute monologue and also unempathetic behavior probably and I brought it up to him. To this, his hypothesis was that I am probably overwhelmed by the amount of work there is do. I half agreed and then brought up how it's been difficult to accept that I won't have a normal life like most of my friends who have a natural will to live while I am constantly fighting suicidal thoughts.  To this , he disagreed. His response was 'I don't think they all have a natural will to live, they all nurture the healthy part of them and that's why they are able to fight and even I had suicidal thoughts 3 months back. Everyone feels like that when things arent good''. After this I tried explaining how not everyone feels that way when life gets rough but even if they do, that's not how I experience them. The way I feel is constantly suicidal even during good times because there is always the slightest things that feel overwhelming and sometimes it feels like life is too difficult cause of its intensity. But he just responded saying that it will all go in therapy to just focus on the process. There was no emotional support what so ever. It felt very mechanical and very invalidating. It is even worse cause of the fact that he was so validating the first couple of sessions and now I feel my imposter syndrome is back with more intensity. Cause I feel maybe the longer he spoke, the more he understands I am faking it , kind of thoughts. I feel like I am weakling for being sick and also I feel so misunderstood.  Please help me understanding if I am overreacting.  Cause that is something that happens and I am scared I might be splitting.  I am a mess really."
3028,Just a pathetic rant,w3inks,BlueSuisen,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3inks/just_a_pathetic_rant/,2,depression,False,"I wish I was never born, so that I wouldn't have to deal with life. I wish I wasn't loved, so that I would at least be able to end it all knowing those around me won't grieve my death. But in the end, I just want to live my life with the rest of those I have.. to be able to smile and laugh and make memories before I go back to being nothing.

The only issue is that.. Well, I'm holding myself back. 

My textbook stereotypical asian parents told me that all I needed to do was just work hard, study hard, get a high paying job, happiness. It was only until college that I realized that I had severe social anxiety, no close friends, no passion for my current major, and no fucking idea what im going to do for the next 75% of my life.

Goddamn. I'm at the most fuckable time of my life and all I've got is a porn addiction and the inability to buy stuff at the store without thinking ahead 7 parallel universes ahead of the cashier and I genuinely cannot stop giggling at how pathetic it all is.

But everything is just so so so fucking scary. Adulting? Taxes? My future? Huh? I know mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. I don't understand any of it and it's terrifying to not know what's ahead. And it's even more terrifying to know I'm only moving forward because of the momentum from what my parents told me to do as a child. And i'm afraid of what will happen to me once that momentum ends.

What does it mean to live for myself? I just did what they told me to do. I'm screaming at myself to get out of my bed, get out of my room, please touch some grass I'm begging you. Just fuckig kill yourself. But im fucking hopeless. Again and again I just stick with what I feel safe with. It's like being a corpse, not even in control of my own body. I was puppeteered by studying and school up till this far, and I realize now that for the past 21 years I have not actually lived.

I want to say it's too late now. My childhood is long gone. It's not too late though. I can still live life, I just need to move. I just need to find a reason to live.. Something to get me through this endless repetitive life. Something to get me through the lonely nights.

I love my parents, I wish my dad would actually talk to me, but I can tell he's just a big softy on the inside. And my mom is the cutest old asian lady you'll ever find. (Bit of a Karen though). My siblings have grown up into such great people. I wish.. I wish I were more like them. My friends are goofy as fuck but I genuinely love having them around.

But there's nothing here for me. I have them but I don't have myself. This constant dread knowing that I'll never love myself and never be able to feel truly happy. That constant whisper in my head saying that they're all better off without me, and that I should just be free of my responsibility to stay alive.

I look around me and I feel undeserving of this hollowness. The shit people go through, and I don't fucking compare. I wouldn't be surprised if this post was removed for being irrelevant lol. My struggles compared to other people are the equivalent of an anti masker not wanting to smell their own shitty breath vs. someone with crippling chronic pain. All my traumas are long behind me. I don't think they're affecting me anymore. I've been lurking around and you guys are so much stronger than I could ever be haha. From those fighting depression and those here fighting to cure it, I love you all. I wish I had a fraction of some of the strength you guys have.

Typed more than I thought. I'll be here with my earbuds around my neck and doorknob while listening to my favorite songs.

Love you all, see you tomorrow.

I started using drugs and drinking right at the end of high school and ended up not going to college. Instead I started working at a grocery living with my dad. I really loved it at first and wanted to make a career out of it. but after a few years I wasn’t getting promotions and I started drinking and using more drugs. I eventually quit my job and spent a few months at home being a menace to my father.


That’s right - I spent 18-23 getting drunk at my dad’s apartment pretending to be a rockstar. Sucks.


I got really “out there” and eventually had a breakdown which resulted in my dad kicking me out. I gave up the drugs and am now completely sober. I’m now living with roommates working at Home Depot. 


It’s a better situation than I was in a year ago — I know that and I am grateful for it. Drugs are bad. Now I know. But now I’m left with the cleanup. I didn’t go to college or trade school. I failed at retail. I have no skills. I have pretty bad cognitive/social issues that make dealing with people very hard. I’m not sure if I have the mental ability to do anything else. 


I feel like I’ve woken up out of a long, dark sleep. I’m seeing reality for the first time in years and the reality is depressing. I hit the stop button but the years kept coming. What a m I going to do with my life? I have missed out on so much."

I fell into complete despair but didn’t realize I had a major issue. In my second year of uni, I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I started treatment for it and did a little bit better that year. I started making some progress but then covid happened. I had to return back home. Being around my family made me feel like even more of a failure because I was not living up to their expectations. I come from a family of doctors, engineers, and lawyers, so the fact that I failed in school hurt a lot because it felt like I was the family f\*ck up. Even though they tried, they don’t understand mental health well, so couldn’t give me the support I desperately needed. I was already at a low point in life but then my mom passed away. I became even more numb. I started getting some dark thoughts and was completely hopeless. I had no will to live anymore. A year has passed since then.

I recently lowered my dose of lithium and I was feeling the best I have in a long time. Not great or anything just like I wouldn’t need to cry everyday. 
And I was taking a tiny bit of Quetiapine for sleep and it never helped me sleep. So I stopped taking it because I don’t want so many medications in my body. But after I stopped taking it I dipped into a deep depression, I had forgotten how that felt. When I made the connections and started taking it again after less than a week I felt a little better, but nowhere near where I was even before lowering the lithium. It’s almost two weeks that I’ve been taking the Quetiapine again now, nothings changing. 

Today I was ok and I went to the movies by myself, but as soon as I got home and sat down I started crying for now reason. I wish I knew what to do, I feel so stupid that I stopped taking it. I know it can take time to start working again, but it’s so hard to hang in there. Part of me wonders if it was even the Quetiapine that caused this. I’m scared I’m waiting for change where there might not be one. My psychiatrist said it was weird that 25mg of Quetiapine would even help my depression that much.

I’m just tired of taking so much medication and still feeling this way. It’s so exhausting, I tried 16 medications for my depression before I got to this point. 

A year ago yesterday I was in hospital because I was so suicidal. And I’ve come very far, but I feel like I’m heading back there and I’m scared. 

My life is often a cycle of small improvement followed by huge negative change even when it’s not to do with medication.

3047,How can I best help my depressed sister??,w3a93y,anonsisterheheh,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3a93y/how_can_i_best_help_my_depressed_sister/,6,depression,False,"Hi! I’d love to hear ur input, especially if you are in a depression right now. Sounds odd and I’m sorry, but this is the “insider info” I need.

backstory:
I (F 21) have a sister (F21) who is in a deep clinical depression. We’re both freshly divorced out of toxic marriages (2-3 years where one of us was mentally abused, the other severely physically + mentally abused) and for those years we haven’t been able to see eachother, at the demand of our then husbands. We used to be super close as we are twin s.

We’re both out of it now and spend much of our time together. We share a room and plan to start a new education together (we weren’t allowed to study when married by spouses) and everything is going better! Although, even though I feel generally very happy and have a light view on life, my sister is suffering. She even tried to take her own life - unsuccesfully, thank god. She is on anti depressants and generally looks sad. 

I try to be as positive around her at all times - I fail often and argue, but wish to get better. I feel like it helps to stay positive especially when something irritating or bad happens by shifting our focus or saying “it is what it is, fuck it” etc
I make sure to clean the room and told her I would take care of the bills, so she doesn’t have to work.  (She’s been working a job and newly “quit”) Reason for this is she gets overly exhausted just by working 2-3 hours. I know she feels extremely bad for this and has apologized numerous times for not being ablw to “bring something to the table” but i dont agree with this at all! (She helped me get out of the major dept my ex husband left me with btw)
I just want her to focus on herself

Now, I know her too well to know that she holds back asking me for help, and I don’t know how to. Please share the things someone you know has done for you, that helped you in your depression.. I’d really appreciate it!

*i’m absolutely not saying that i am the solution and want/can cure her depression, she has started going to therapy and is doing her very best to battle this*"
3048,Kids always seem to come between,w3gqtp,mr_incredible498,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3gqtp/kids_always_seem_to_come_between/,2,depression,False,"So I have 3 wonderful kids. I have two boys with my ex partner who are young teenagers (12 and 13) and I have a daughter who is almost 3 with my wife.
When my two boys were born my ex partner started to drift away from me, she became meaner and more detached, not showing as much attention to me and rebuffing my attempts to keep the little shows of affection that we’d had up to then (butt squeezing, hand on lap, random hugs and kisses) and it eventually came between us and we broke up.
Now I feel like my wife is slowly going the same way inadvertently. My wife is much much nicer and loving woman than my ex and she hasn’t become mean in any way. But the shows of affection have almost come to a halt and I feel like I’m the only one that ever sends cute texts or gets random little gifts or gives her a kiss out of the blue or anything like that.
Before you say have I spoke to her yes I have and she said she didn’t realise and will try to get back to it but so far she hasn’t.
For someone who’s love language is physical touch I’m feeling really deflated and insecure and because the kids are the common factor in these two instances I’m beginning to feel a twinge of regret which I hate myself for because they are all amazing children."

I don’t understand why such shitty things happens to good people who try to love you even though you show little to no love back, it’s like I scratch someone’s back and they spit on mine. I wish I was dead because it’s like the only thing that I truly want, I don’t want a wife, I don’t want fake friends anymore, I’m tired of smoking weed to feel something, praying and only being condemned.

I'm currently taking care of an uncles dog and at first I thought my feeling of loneliness went having this dog around me at all times but no again I still feel alone. One of the few times I feel less alone is with my therapist, very fucking sad when you see the guy you pay to listen to ya rant about your feelings as possibly one of the only people that gets ya. I've given up on the whole dating thing attempting to meet people out in bars or through apps where I simply never stood a chance. I'm a shy introverted guy but I've really tried all my life to push myself to make friends and yet I find that even when I do push myself I don't even connect with the people I meet. All my dreams that I remember are simply me with folk enjoying myself and I don't know what it is but in my dreams I just connect with people then and that's when I'm most happy. If I could have a permanent way of having those dreams maybe life would be more enjoyable but alas as people have told me sleeping forever is essentially death being a little shy keeping you in a coma. I wouldn't mind that though which I know is selfish of me to say as there are folk out there who are in a coma and likely if they could wake up would take that chance with tons of people wanting them to wake up also. Anyway yeah just another lonely guy out there in the world I guess.

TL;DR: Don't feel like I connect with people like friends and family. Want to sleep forever as my dreams bring me some happiness as I feel less lonely having the people in these dreams connect well with me."

I wish for death every day. I wish I would just stop existing. I wish when my mum had twins one of them was a girl so she wouldn’t have still wanted a girl and had me. I feel so alone. The worse I feel, the less I reach out for help and the more surface level my conversations with my friends get. I’m 28 and the thought of around 40-50 more years of existence does not sound exciting but draining and a struggle.

Cut next to 2022, she has anxiety issues still but very manageable. Few days ago, she was in hostel and she saw one girl collapsing down. The girl is fine now but that picture is haunting my girlfriend. She cannot sleep properly. She cannot live in hostel. She has become very quiet. Some other things I noticed were - appetite loss, sudden crying, palpation, shivering and shaking of legs.
I have tried talking to her about this but she always breaks down while talking so I don't do it anymore.
What are the steps I can take to help her or steps she can take for herself.

I’m in my head all day all night and it killing me inside. Before we moved, I was already in a bad mental state (it’s been yrs now tbh), but I had a job there and was in university so I was occupied. But right now, I’m in my head all day, thinking about my problems and just feeling like shit.. I’m not going to university until next yr since I was planning to work for the rest of the yr to save some money but that plan is going down the drain.

I have no friends aside from my ex and not being able to talk to another human being is driving me crazy. I have some art talent but in my emotional state I'm far from a position where I can create something and enjoy both the process and the result.

Some days I have this short euphoria where I feel like I can turn my life around and become a better version of myself, only to feel utterly hopeless and severely depressed the next day.

My parents divorced 3 years ago, I live with my mom. My father was a manipulator and I believe he was the one who made me this way. He admitted to my brother that he hated me and didn't consider me his daughter in any way after I decided to live with my mom.
My mom met another guy, a toxic one too, one that would insult her and throw her out of his house when things were getting heated up between them. She came crying to me so much. I did my best to give her useful advices but in the end she broke up 4 times with him only to get back to him every single time. She likes him better than me and my brother despites what she affirms. She is always praising him and I get angry because she would never forgive us as much.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression and bipolarity. I need to take meds for this and I put on some weight a bit...

I wanted to go to medical  school so badly, but I failed all the entry exams. I can't study properly anymore. 
My last chance to get into the medical field is to pass an exam next month in Belgium. I know I'm gonna fail, like everytime.
I keep failing failing failing.

I feel like my mom changed a lot since she knows that guy, she is growing tired of me, she is always snapping at me, she wants to decide my every move. I'm in vacations at my grandma's house with her and my brother but she keeps bugging me, telling me I should study, that I should lose weight because now I don't fit in anything. I'm fat in her eyes.
Today she made me cry my eyes out because I feel so much like a waste of air, space, food, money and time for her.
My family keeps making remarks about my weight and I feel like the whole world is against me. I went to the gym but that's not enough... 
I feel like a financial burden to my mom since she keeps saying she doesn't want to spend money.
But when I try to spend mine that I earnt by working during a year,  she prevents me to do so and says I should keep it for Belgium because she ain't gonna pay.

I think my dream shattered. 
I don't even wanna pass this stupid exam anymore.
I've lost interest in everything.
I feel empty most of the time.

The only reason I didn't kill myself yet is because I care about my boyfriend and brother. 
But now....I came to a point where I don't really care anymore. Sometimes this voice inside my head tells me to put an end to this bad comedy.
I'm tired, tired of failing everything, tired of not having normal parents, tired of life.

3079,Absolute Motivation,w3c4dh,singularity48,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3c4dh/absolute_motivation/,3,depression,True,"So there it is, I need to work a shitty job somewhere where I'm going to be called a school shooter again, or a future serial killer. That's to save $6,700 to cover the cost of my funeral and cremation. The dark reality of it, that's what it costs and there's no way I'm going to risk death in the light of my family having to cover the costs for a business itself.

$6,700, either could motivate my end, or could motivate my ability to move the hell out of hell. In such a case, the hell out of the USA where people simply force you down their roads without giving two shits about you. Nor are people willing to apologize for known wrongs they'd committed, cowards. This place is morally fucked and I've got my internal beast under tight chains where I haven't one desire to further the suffering of life onto another. That's not me. If anything I understand pain like the back of my hand. Coincidentally there's a scar there in the shape of a heart, put there when I tapped a cigarette out on my wrist. It was only when I looked down the next morning that I saw it was a heart. While laying down next to what is and has been the only woman on this planet to show my a side I never thought had existed in 27 years of solitude.

I'm not seeking help, nor do I appreciate people pushing the need for me to seek professional help. Problem is, after a solid two years of studying psychology, I learned a lot about why this world is the way it is, especially America. It's essentially creating hell on earth in a way that doesn't end well, like a grand final experiment of humanity. 

The people who've had comfort to the existential degree won't comprehend nor care. The people that do see this are the ones without any power, yet. Power doesn't come via physical action or things, it come's by standing one's ground. Knowing humanity has crossed a very fine line. Either we can allow the meaning of this life to further its state of self-destruction, or we can stand up to blatant crimes against humanity.

Only in a seriously fucked social state could one be pushed to contemplate going on with an illusion, or joining death. I've had a near-death experience, I'm not afraid. What fucks me in the head is what I learned about this cursed planet afterwords. Some of it goes beyond that of mere words.

Is life valuable, yes. Is it far more hell than should be necessary, absofuckinglutly. Funniest thing is, I'm not depressed, because knowing freed me. It was only once I knew I became socially disposed which killed off whatever connection I use to have to people I considered friends. At a very moment in my life when I'd only just become social. I've seen the angels in people, I also see demons. Never trust a smile."

So far, I've had 1 brother run away only to live a worse life. Another brother recently reached adulthood and is probably already struggling. Whenever he is asked about college, he gives a what sounds like excuse. A lot of times when I feel I can finally trust someone, they ruin it, leading me to trust less and less people. I have a lack of interest because when I was still young and sensitive, anything I put interest in got made fun of. Also my step brother used to punch me a lot, making me very jumpy. I hate unfair things, which makes it worse when I share chores but am told to do them more a lot more than the other person (I know that's a bit childish, but I'm still pretty young).

Father was emotionally abusive and drug user. Mother couldn’t afford to leave and he physically abused her. I had to start working at a young age to help provide groceries since my father didn’t want to help support my family. He was either off cheating, doing pills, smashing things, and yelling. Sometimes he would throw knives at me and sharp objects. Threatened to kick out my mom sister and I to out to start a new family. But he tried to act like father of the year to his family and everyone believed him or excused his behavior. Even when he would force us to family events and my mom would have a black eye. 
I had to act like my moms husband and be her emotional and financial support. Also for my sister. I was ashamed of my life and grew up in a suburb with the normal families. Which fathers cared for their children, didn’t abuse them, and could just be kids. I had to grow up fast. I was bullied in high school and had really bad anxiety and depression with home and social life. Studying and grades were my only saving grace. I worked hard to get a good scholarship and leave for college out of state. Before I left for college, my father smashed everything in the house because the tv wasn’t working and called me a dumb bitch because I didn’t call the cable company fast enough. Even though it was maintenance going on. He was always very sexist and would belittle me because I was a girl. I then ran to the next train and haven’t spoken to him since. I still had to help give money to my mom and sister. It was taking a toll on my providing for myself and two other people. We had a big fight and didn’t talk for a month. During that time, she reconnected with a childhood friend that was also veing abused by his wife. They bonded and soon started to date. I don’t blame her. I always wanted my mother to leave my father to find a man that actually cares for her. I then found out my father began trying to choke my mother in her sleep and she knew one day he was going to kill her. My sister had to intervene and go on his back and stop him. Finally after another morning of abusive, she had the courage to call the cops and they arrested him. She now has a restraining order against him and he is facing a criminal trial soon for assault and battery. My sister is living at my aunt and uncles which she is happy with since she always liked my cousins better than me. She always put me down and the only thing that made her like me was money. We don’t talk now either. The only two people I have left in my life are my mom and her new boyfriend. I’ve know him my whole life and he’s very sweet. He’s been more of a dad to me than my sperm donor ever was. But sometimes I get treated like a third wheel with them. I do have my maternal grandmother but she is very sick and is more hostile since she’s gotten older. I have done well academically and financially. I have a good paying job and made some cool friends. I’ve also been trying to get into the dating scene. But I get scared because of my past. No one would want to be with a girl like me and my baggage :( my depression and axienty has been even worse. I feel inferior to people with normal parents. Like I’m the kid people don’t want their children hanging around because I’m from a poor and abusive household. I still carry that mentality. I do have one friend who knows the truth about my life and can relate since her parents are the same way. 
My problem is that I told another really close friend of mine about my past and I don’t want them to look at me any differently now. I regret it so much. I really hate myself. I don’t have the balls to kill myself but sometimes I think the world would be a better off without me. I’m a waste of space"

I was wondering if this could be due to depression causing lower sex drive? 

Last week and this week, she hasn’t been feeling her best due to anxiety and depression, one day she just stayed in bed all day and couldn’t move. 

We’ve recently started getting a bit more serious and I learned about her struggle with mental health.

my family is so fucking annoying. the first few months back from the psych ward were light but once summer hit, shit just went back to how it was before. my mom is the fucking worst of the bunch. i’ve essentially dropped out of college junior year because of MDD and i was hoping home would be a calm place. don’t know why i expected that, nothing in its track record before would hint to that. 

now i know i don’t have much bargaining power living under their roof rent free (rent is a fucking ridiculous concept but i digress) but  she is making things more difficult than they need to be. i take care of chores around the house and they’re done by the end of the day but for some reason she still doesn’t fucking trust me to do them and annoys me all day about it to the point that the second i step foot out of my room she’s on my back. 

not to mention the incessant nagging and pestering to go to church with them on sundays. they finally stopped asking cause i decided to stop getting up on sundays but it’s still clear that they hate it. see they claimed it’s so they could keep an eye on me to make sure i’m safe, which start is extremely condescending and also fundamentally not true. not only was i actively hurting myself under their noses for half a year, they don’t actually see me most of the day cause i’m hiding in my room. 

it’s clear that they think i need their imaginary god.  i wouldn’t have a problem with them being christians if they just kept it to themselves and stopped trying to insert it into my life. i left christianity for a fucking reason. i’m not going to go to a church every sunday that preaches from a book that despises my existence as a bisexual man. 

something’s gotta change soon or else a major argument is going to happen which i can only assume will make things worse.

I was left without a family. I only had a dog that was everything to me. And I didn't kill myself for her. Who was going to feed him? Who was going to give him water? She was going to be sick with sadness.
My friends from church promised my mom they wouldn't leave me alone, but in less than two weeks they stopped visiting me, calling me, or writing to me.
Almost a year after my mom, I got married to someone much younger than me.
Once again I had to deal with other people's opinion but we moved on (we've been together for almost 8 years).
Year 2015.
My dog ​​finally died after being with me for 11 wonderful years. It hurt horribly.
He didn't want any more pets.
Year 2017: I lose a pregnancy and I can't recover or get over it. I can't have children and that will hurt me until I die.
I resigned myself to raising animals, but like I said, I didn't want any more pets. Until I had to adopt a kitten that had been thrown out. I fed him with a syringe and taught him everything. It fit in my hands. Year 2018.
When the pandemic arrived in 2020 with the quarantine, my cat became the only tangible and real thing I had. I loved that cat. He was my partner and he was very happy.
I knew that it was very bad for me that my emotional health depended on a cat.
One day I go to work and my cat is not there. I called it. I looked it up. I waited for it...
He had been run over and died.
My world came crashing down. All my emotional stability turned into a disaster. My depression came back and stayed there, stronger.
Year 2021. An injured kitten appears in my house. I cured him and gave him shelter. I didn't want to get attached because I know it hurts me a lot when they're gone.
I got attached.
A few days ago he disappeared. I already fear the worst.
I look for it, I call it, I wait for it... And history repeats itself. I despair. I cry.
I realize that I have no emotional stability.
I feel like I'm useless. Neither to be a mother nor to take care of animals. Everything gets out of hand. I am useless.
My boyfriend is the only thing I have but I don't want to burden him with my problems either.

3093,I’m not a person,w38xv5,jason_becker_isgoat,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w38xv5/im_not_a_person/,4,depression,True,"

I’m a shell, I don’t remember the last time I was happy, I don’t remember the last time I was excited for anything, I don’t remember feeling sadness or anger; though I must’ve felt them at some point because I know what they are. 

Most times I feel absolutely nothing, and the times when I do feel something it’s pure self hatred, misery and dread all mixed together in some unholy cocktail of despair. Those times I usually just blast music or go to sleep. Most days I just go through the motions, walk the streets among people, yet feel completely isolated, I can count on one hand the amount of interactions I’ve had with people this month.

The only thing that brings me any kind of solice is music, I’m always listening to it, and when I’m not I’m playing guitar, which I play atleast 6hours a day, started at 13, thought if I won’t be happy I might aswell be great; and maybe that will bring me happiness. Hasn’t worked, though I’m good, I just hate talking to people too much, hate vapid social media too much to market myself or join a band.

And that’s the thing, I despise talking to people, simply buying food fills me with an absolute sensation of imminent doom, it feels like it physically revolts me, contorts what little of a soul I have. No friends, never a girlfriend, or a boyfriend for that matter, though there have been people who tried, I pushed them away. Only some hookups that all left me feeling used and dirty, had to stay in the shower for some hours after each. I kept doing it though, not sure why.


And there’s not even a reason for any of this, no explanation to rationalize it. Good parents, good homelife, upper middle class, good country, no diagnosed mental illness, not exceptionally dumb, not physically ugly, in good shape, etc.

I honestly don’t think I can survive, I feel like a dead man walking, already buried in my coffin."

Normally, things are alright. I don’t really think much of myself, and I even sometimes think I’m a good person. Other times, such as today, reality dawns on me and tells me everything wrong about who I am.

I just feel that there isn’t much worthwhile about me as a person. Sure, I get decent grades, I got accepted into college, and can be friendly when talking to people, but none of that matters. I practically never talk to anyone, so being friendly doesn’t do much. I practically never think before I act, and never really look at my surroundings either. Being decent at math doesn’t matter if I never stop to think “hey, maybe I should turn off that light that was CLEARLY left on by mistake.” I notice that I’m quite lazy too. When school was still going, I would constantly put off schoolwork and just do my own thing instead. My grades were still decent, but they would have been so much better had I actually taken time to work on projects in class. I’ve waited way too long to be able to get a job and work on getting my drivers license, going for months without doing anything about it (despite constantly being reminded of it). I make plenty of dumb mistakes that typical people rarely ever make, and it just makes me feel completely worthless since they’re mistakes that I wouldn’t be making if I weren’t a less-than-average person. Every time I think of myself as overworked or mistreated, I notice how much my dad works, which basically tells me that things are much worse for him and that I have it easy.

Overall, I just feel like a useless, annoying person to be around. I would sometimes even say that I’m undeserving of love an affection. I know y’all are going to tell me that I’m overreacting, and there there are still positive things about me, and that’s fine. This is who I am, and how I truly see myself. 

TL/DR: A summary of the overwhelming negative aspects of who I am."

For context, I was renting a room from a woman in a couple towns over while working (30+ hours) and doing full time school for a little over a year. I got on the deans list my first year of college but overtime I wore myself out with this routine and decided at the beginning of this year I needed a break. I felt so drained and had little energy for anything. I thought a break would bring back my drive and motivation but I find myself still in a rut. I think the break seemed to have worsened these feelings. I have no direction for future goals or life plans. Now that it's been almost 8 months since I've been to school I just don't find myself longing to go back. 
I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, I'm in therapy and should be taking my meds but the possible side affects make me not want to. 
I know im young and it's normal to feel like you have no idea what you're doing, but the longer I stay unemployed (work is seasonal here and summer there's no jobs) and burden my parents with my presence the more I hate myself. I don't know what to do or where to turn, everytime I try to sit and think about it I get too overwhelmed. Part of me wishes I was never born, and a part of me wishes I could just stick with something for once. I put on this happy persona for my family, they all think I'm okay, but I feel like I'm falling apart. I feel like a fucking failure and a loser with nothing to show for my existence besides being a depressed sack of shit.

3103,Very depressed about my height,w3gq34,pandabearasd123,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3gq34/very_depressed_about_my_height/,1,depression,False,"Hello guys,

I am 16.5 year old guy and I am 5'6.5 and for the past year I have been very very depressed about my height. It all began when I was 13 and I was made fun of for being short, but I thought I was average height so I didn't really worry about it. Then, when I was 15 I went to this group with people my age and everyone was taller than me, it was very humiliating. I came back home and measured myself and I realized I was very short when compared to the average height my age. When I told my parents **(my mum is 5'6 and my dad is 5'9)** about this, they said 'oh they are just older than you', and they made bad excuses that were actually insane, since everyone there was literally my age or a year older.

Recently I have been obsessing every second of the day over my height. This is mostly because I don't remember growing at all since the last year, and this has made me want to kill myself. I made a pact with myself that if I don't grow to at least 5'9 by 18 or 19 I will kill myself, because it's not worth living a life being short. I have no friends in real life or a girlfriend (which is abnormal for my age). I think it is to do with my height and that girls do not want to date short guys.

I have been watching very depressing/sad blackpill stuff recently about how women care a lot about height I have been extremely depressed, worried, and anxious about it, but at the same time I don't think it's blackpill I think height is actually very important in finding a girlfriend. Anyways I have also been very depressed because of the fact that I have only 1 and a half years until I am 18 and done growing. I find it unrealistic that I will grow to 5'10, so I know that I will most likely b short. When I ask my parents if I can grow taller they said 'yes of course you can grow until 24 and you will be 6ft when you're older', idk if they actually believe it or not, but I heard online you stop growing at 18 and that you barely grow at 16, when I told them this they said it's misinformation and that men stop growing at 24.

Recently I've been noticing that everywhere I go I am treated like a kid, and everyone I see my age is at least 4+ inches taller than me. Once I went to this youth group event and everyone there was my age or younger, and they were very very tall, even the girls were like 5'10+. We had to go around telling our ages and when I said I was 16 everyone acted confused and laughed, this was humiliating as hell.

I have tried to speak to my parents about it, but they don't understand and they think I am **very tall for my age because I am taller than my 5'6 mum (only be 0.5 inch).** When I tell my dad ""dad I am short bro can I go on HGH or can I go to a doctor to see if my growth plates are fused"", they get very angry and tell me to shutup and stop whining, they say that only if I was a dwarf they'd care. My dad has been calling me selfish for being depressed about it, and he says I'm tall. It's made me second guess whether or not I'm insane, but I think I am short... But when my parents tell me I'm not it makes me feel like I am an insane guy...

Anyways I've been extremely depressed about it, I haven't been able to focus on my work or live a normal life... Any advice would be appreciated as to how to overcome this, or if anyone else is short can they share their experiences how they stop being depressed about it."

3107,What is this feeling that is constantly invading my mind?,w3codz,DeadGravityyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3codz/what_is_this_feeling_that_is_constantly_invading/,2,depression,False,"The best way to describe it would be to explain how it works. Basically, anywhere I go, or for that matter, anywhere I happen to be, whether it's a picture online, or an actual location, a specific ""vibe"" or ""feeling"" gets automatically associated with that area. The reason it is debilitating for me is that it makes it REALLY fucking hard to enjoy new places (or old, familiar places) if my mind decides that ""Place A"" is creepy, or if ""Place B"" feels ""off."" What's more, is that it also applies to media (movies, anime, games), my mind automatically assigns a ""feeling"" to these things as well, and more often than not, my judgement on them is heavily biased because of this issue.

This feeling is almost always negative, or just outright feels ""off."" BUT, on the off chance it's not, I end up REALLY enjoying wherever I am, or whatever I'm looking at. It's a very complicated issue, and the only thing I can say for certain is that certain lighting conditions can make or break a place for me. AND that it does not matter where I am, I ALWAYS get this feeling no matter what situation I am in.

I have had this issue ever since I was a kid (I am 24 now). I've got no idea what to even call it (and have a very hard time explaining it as you can see), but it feels like a mental illness with how debilitating it can be. And I almost always end up ""mentally judging"" something if it makes me ""feel"" right or not, which is bad."

Perhaps they are pushing me to a breaking point and there is no recovery insight. I believe this is the case. I have one person who may or may not be a friend. The other two people are my mom and sister. Below is a message from the person who may or may not be my friend. What are your thoughts on it? Thank you.

“After today I realize you can't even understand why life is how it is for you  now matter how it's explained.  People don't owe you respect, love, courtesy, patience, help, participation, compliments or anything and the reason is simple.
 
They either have to want to or simply believe you deserve it.  Keep in mind there are some people that may believe you deserve it but don't want to give it to you.  

Now they are not required to prove anything to you, or explain ""why"" to you, nor have a back and forth debate with examples of why you deserve more. It goes back to a feeling of if they want to.  It's a feeling and a feeling is a unique emotion and a private right.  

Learn that.

3111,Starting to Think I Deserve to Be Alone,w3cm8b,falconreach21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3cm8b/starting_to_think_i_deserve_to_be_alone/,2,depression,False,"I'm a 21M who has struggled with relationships my entire life. No matter how hard I try I can't seem to get past a second date. I take my time, I try to get to know the girls I'm interested in, I try to show interest in their passions, etc. but nothing works. If my friends are to be believed, I'm not a bad looking guy but that doesn't seem to matter either. 

About a month ago I matched with this amazing girl on Bumble, we'll call her C. C had this really unique starter where she asked ""If your current mental state were an egg, what kind of egg would it be?"" We had great conversations. Every message was at least a paragraph or more in length. We talked about reading, writing, cooking, hiking, college, and everything else we could think of. It all felt like it was going so well. Everything about her was exactly what I had been looking for in a girl. She was passionate, driven, beautiful, smart, funny in a way, kind/compassionate, didn't care much for drinking, didn't smoke or do drugs, was religious but not in a super forced way, and so much more. In my head, she really was perfect. Conversations never seemed difficult with her and we talked every single day.

About 2 weeks in we exchanged numbers and started texting. About a month after we matched we finally had our first date. Let me tell you, the pictures didn't even begin to do C justice. She was gorgeous! She had these gorgeous green eyes that sparkled in the sun like little gems. She was very friendly, albeit a bit nervous but so was I! She laughed a lot and almost never stopped smiling. The date went so well. At the end before I could say anything she went ""Well this was a lot of fun!"" and we spoke a few moments longer before leaving. I texted her later on and said I had a really good time and would love to take her out on another date. She texted back a couple of hours later and said she had a fun time too and agreed we should hang out again. That's where the positivity stops...

Immediately after that, within the same text, she said she had gotten out of a 2 year long relationship back in November and realized that she wasn't ready to start up dating again. She said she'd be open to being friends though. I was devastated. Every possible negative thought ran through my mind and I went out to my car to cry. All of this culminated in an anxiety attack similar to ones I'd had in the past during similar events. My friends followed me out and eventually calmed me down enough that I was able to speak. I texted C back and asked if it was something that happened during the date that caused this. I asked if she'd want to slow things down, start as hanging out as friends and being open to dates in the future once she had time to heal, I also asked if she planned to continue on Bumble as, even if we were to just be friends for the time being, given her reasoning for not going further, it would hurt me to see her immediately dating someone else. She replied once. She said it wasn't anything I did but the reality of meeting up finally hit her and made her realize she wasn't ready. C said that she wasn't sure about the future as it was too uncertain but she likely wouldn't be pursuing a serious relationship for a while. She then apologized for not telling me sooner as she was just trying to push past it and go all in. I was still hurt. She didn't answer my question about continuing to date even though she knew she wasn't ready. She kinda dodged the question about being open to a relationship in the future. I was confused as to how it all went wrong so fast. I texted back immediately restating some questions and also telling her I was open to being friends still... No response. I apologized if I came off as unsympathetic as I was just looking for some kind of answers... No response. I gave it a few hours and sent her a song (this was something we had done a few times over the course of our month talking)... No response. I texted her the next day and apologized for being insensitive to her feelings. I told her I was hurt but that didn't excuse me for seemingly disregarding her feelings on the matter. I told her I understood what it was like to lose a loved one in a break-up type manner and I should have checked up on her and apologized again. I apologized for everything I could think of that I could have done wrong, then asked her how she was doing. I wanted to make sure she was okay... No response. I sent one more apology saying I didn't mean to upset or offend her. Telling her I do want to be friends and that I'll be sure to be better about respecting boundaries. I explained I didn't mean to make it seem like she was forced into anything... No response. 

I had been holding out hope that maybe she was just busy. We were still matched on Bumble, so surely we were okay and she was just processing? No. Today is the 3rd day since I'd last heard from C and I opened Bumble to see she had unmatched me. That was it. That was her way of communicating that we were done. I sent her one final text. I told her I was sorry. I told her I hoped she would get the time to heal and find closure. I told her I hoped she would find a good person who will love her for everything she was. She's an amazing girl, after all. She deserves the best. One last time I told her that if she still ever wanted a friend in me she had one, no strings of relationships attached. Then I signed off with ""I wish you all the best and hope to hear from you again one day.""

&#x200B;

I'm defeated. I struggle opening up to people because my greatest fear in life is losing people. I hate the idea of someone I am close to, someone I respect and love, leaving my life for whatever reason. This has happened a few times in the past and it's never been pretty. The first time I had a friend meet me in a parking lot. He had to talk me down from suicide. The second time I lost someone who I had been best friends with for years, I'd been in love with her for even longer, and because of her parents she was ripped away in a single night. That one resulted in me being taken to the hospital because I was ready to end it again. The third time was last summer when another person who I had let in and gotten close to at work decided to leave kind of out of nowhere. That was the least difficult as I hadn't known her for that long. This time, though... I had finally let someone back in. Let C see me vulnerable. I had gone on the date. I had taken time to get into her interests. I spent hours listening to audiobooks. I learned how to make chocolate for her. I really tried to pull out all of the stops. And I was hit with just being friends. I was hurt, but I'd recover... that was until she ghosted me. 

I struggle a lot when I don't have definitive answers. I went deep this time. I wouldn't eat, wouldn't leave my room unless it was to drive for hours trying to clear my head. I prayed a lot. I begged to know why this was happening to me. I cried, screamed, yelled. Why was I not good enough? Why was C put in my life then immediately taken away? Why couldn't we be friends? Why couldn't I fix this? Why wouldn't she answer? I sat outside a church that she and I used to do ballroom classes at (we didn't know each other at the time but we had been there at the same time without ever having met which was another reason I felt this was some kind of 'meant to be' type thing), yelling to God with a knife to my throat. I couldn't take it anymore. Luckily I was able to pull back. I didn't cut myself at all. Since then I've been slowly getting better. I've spoken to my friends and they've helped a bit but I still feel a hole in my chest. I feel empty. I've tried to get back into dating apps but nobody really feels genuine. Nobody clicks. It just doesn't feel right. I tried to make sure everything went right with C but it still ended up with me being left behind. I'm lost again. I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless. Everyone thinks I'm getting better, and I kind of am, but every night I go to bed with the same thought: ""I hope I don't wake up tomorrow."" Just that thought kills me because I don't want to disappoint them but I'm also not okay. Every time I eat I feel sick afterwards and end up throwing it up (not intentionally). 

I need help. Why is dating so difficult? Am I really that bad? What helps you when you aren't able to get definitive answers? What am I doing wrong and how can I do better? What helps you to move on? Please... what do I have to do to avoid losing people in the future? I'm desperate at this point. I can't take it anymore!"

Starting to really feel what Kurt Cobain felt rn ngl.

Wanted to say, I'm not sucidal, by no means. I've learned my lesson. 60+ lacerations and 7 days in a psychiatric hospital is what I've learned. However, I'm starting to get real tired of this bullshit. I'd never attempt the shit again, but suicidal thoughts circle me 24/7.

I don't think there is a source of happiness for me. Never will I be happy like I was as a kid. I don't find joy in anything really. I fake smile, fake laugh, fake everything. Shit's sad, but everyone is like ""be happy"", I rather be fucking sad than happy. Why? Because if you're sad, you don't get let down.

If I be happy, within a minute, I'll be let down again by life. I rather just stay sad than to be swapping sides every 3 seconds. I also want someone to fucking hurt me, like real bad. I think I deserve the shit tbf. The shit I do, and the people I hurt, I damn well do deserve it.

What I don't deserve is people. I don't deserve anyone at all. And that being said, there's a reason I have Noone. I also don't think I deserve happiness or anything good. My confidence is also nonexistent, because my give a fuck meter ran out a long time ago."
3116,Isolated for couple of years and seasonal depression,w3cegy,peach-tadpole,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3cegy/isolated_for_couple_of_years_and_seasonal/,2,depression,False,"I don't really use Reddit, but I'm struggling to find a spot where I can anonymously dump my thoughts without being judged for them.  I'm also in a healthy relationship with my partner of 4 years and I have been regularly in contact with him and have no issues in our relationship. However, I've been isolating myself from IRL friends for 2 years starting from my junior year of high school until now. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and moderate depression during the year my partner and I were dating, but I make an effort to not let my anxiety and depression to get in the way of our relationship.

For context, I started isolating myself right as the pandemic started. I left every social media I knew and cut off contact with my IRLs. In January 2021, I started going completely AWOL, deleting most of the social media I had and cutting off contact with online friends. I don't exactly recall why, but I think COVID-19 and my anxiety made me scared of going out. They never really cared about COVID-19 in the first place, but my parents were immunocompromised. My parents and I were very strict with ourselves about outings and thankfully, I never went to the Christmas party they had where everyone got COVID-19. However, my isolation has persisted since then and it just feels awful.

This summer, while not as bad as the last two summers, feels really bad for me. I've heard seasonal depression can also hit in the summer, but oh boy, it sure does hit. I made a comeback on social media and started drawing art again. I have an internship and new friends in college. But I feel so depressed. During my isolation, no one really made an effort to talk with me, and while it may be the depression and anxiety manipulating me, I feel like people dislike me for some profound reason. I have had thoughts where I imagined myself dying and other forms of suicidal ideation under the pretense that people would stop disliking me if I was dead.

My boyfriend is very supportive and kind and tells me otherwise/encourages me to reach out, I just can't bring myself to believe him. I know it's my fault for isolating as he's put it, and I know it's not necessarily other people's fault for never reaching out to me. But I'm scared to reach out and I think people hate me by default. I know what the solution is, I know how to fix it, and I know this is all my fault, but I don't know how to get out of it. I want to reach out, I want to stop being lonely, but I feel like I'm losing. I know he isn't wrong, but for once I want my presence to be wanted and I feel like I'm losing by being vulnerable to other people again/reaching out first.

I know I have to change my mindset, but I don't know where to start. How do I start talking to people again and would people actually value my presence? What do people think of being talked to by some person that they haven't seen for a couple of years? And what do I do about this depression?"

Today, I was getting lunch with my sister and she told me some of the awful things that our father said to her. I think my father is really depressed, and he drinks every night. He told me that the day after I moved out that he had a pretty bad hangover. I’m so worried about my dad, he’s on an ssri but i don’t think it’s doing much. My grandparents are dying too and I think it’s a lot for my dad, and I have no idea on how to help. I don’t want to lose my dad."

I cry every day, being alone alone with no one to talk to for like 2 months is really hard.
In my imagination there is an old friend who texts me and asks me to hang out not because I'm in a bad situation but because he just wants to see me, it would be great, but yeah dreams are just dreams.

I’m writing this because of my daily crying, my psychiatrist told my parents that it's ok to cry every day it helps a little bit the situation but not for them, whenever they hear me crying they always call the ambulance and police saying bullshits and I end up in the hospital for 2 days for nothing, I was literally just crying; NOW I HAVE TO GO TO THE NEAREST PARK to cry, yeah, can’t cry at home because my parents can’t stand my depression.
These days they are trying to convince the psychiatrist to put me in a psychiatric clinic because they can't stand a son like me anymore, imagine having 2 parents who tell you that your loneliness is because nobody likes you, because you are a worthless person and you can't have people to like you for your shit personality.
They were physically abusive to me when I was a kid even in my early teens, one time I had a black eye for a discussion with my father, but now that I'm older they verbally hurt me.
Funny how my therapist knows me more than these 2 people I spent my time with for 22 years, he’s literally my father figure.

My parents are supportive of me and when they see me feeling down they usually ask if I'm okay but I just say ""Yeah, I'm fine"" and it ends there. But I feel they tend to veer away from really heavy topics. I was having problems at my uni and I told my parents about them but my dad just got upset because at first, he thought I was overreacting and then he didn't know how to help. Since then I haven't really told them anything. 

But right now, my depression is at an all-time low and I think I really need help. But I don't know how to tell them that because I don't want to worry or upset them. I'm a 20 year old uni student so I can't really afford therapy on my own but I'm really not sure how to bring it up with my parents.

I have learned to manage it without medication and know when it’s coming and can be proactive in dealing with it. 

However, it snuck up on me this time. I haven’t had a depression episode in over a year. I went out today and did things that usually make me happy, and nothing is helping. I feel worthless, anxious, ugly, and alone. 

My best friend recently stopped talking to me and pretty much replaced me. I did way too much for her and it was a very one sided friendship. So I’m feeling very disgusted with myself for even letting that go on as long as it did, and feel anxious that she knows all of my secrets. 

I think that triggered my depression, her being so nasty to me. I don’t have another friend in the world, it’s just me and my daughter. I’m trying to be strong for her, but I’ve been very monotone and zombie like today. 

I don’t remember how to get through this. Any advice, or words of encouragement, or anything? I mostly just want to feel not so alone."

I think it’s really been my breaking point. I’ve had these kind of thoughts for a few years now, but it’s never been this bad. I haven’t really done anything except sleep and play games with my friends. It’s nice talking to them because it distracts me a bit, but I guess you guys can guess what happens after the headphones come off haha. I’m 15 soon turning 16, and I haven’t been doing too hot lately. I’m honestly not sure if I’m depressed or if it’s just breakup pain. I wouldn’t call myself suicidal as of now, like I wouldn’t go out of my way to kill myself. But I’m scared that if this keeps going on I might actually do it. I just don’t feel like living anymore. I’m probably too much of a pussy to ever pull a trigger or tie a noose, but I’m also too lazy to want to keep going. My mom has been asking me about college, about what I want to be and how I’ll work to be successful in life. I don’t know what to tell her and I end up just lying to her face sometimes saying all the random bullshit I know she wants to hear from me. The worst part is that I don’t really care whether or not I make my parents proud. Im not saying I don’t love them, but I don’t really see myself meeting their expectations in 5 years or so. Let alone being alive then. Everyday just feels like a cycle yknow? It feels like I’m just watching the same movie in the back of my head over and over again. I lost a really meaningful friendship recently. I’ve known her since 7th grade and she was the closest friend I’ve ever had. She was really influential in my life and she was someone I could trust and rely on. I think she was the first person I really felt truly safe with. I’ve never been as close with my parents or anyone like I was with her. To make things short I confessed to her that I liked her and felt that we would have amazing chemistry as a couple but it didn’t really work out. We just weren’t ready for a relationship yet, and it was really complicated trying to stay friends after our relationship ended. We don’t talk anymore. I have lost faith in god. Or at least I realized I never had faith in him anyway. I wish i did believe in him. I wish I had faith in something right now. A “Things will always get better!” kind of mentality. I envy people who can power through any hardship by believing in god. I’ve sort of lost sight of who I am and I feel like there is no purpose of living. Obviously I want to make the most of it as I’m already here and alive, but it’s really hard to do that when you have no idea why you have to be living in the first place. At this point I’m just rambling, but to be honest I really do want help. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about how I’m feeling, and I don’t trust my parents enough to tell them. I just want some insight in life from someone who’s older because I haven’t been able to think clearly lately."

He was right, but I always thought of going to a professional as my last resort... because if that doesn't help me, what will? Before, if things got worse I thought to myself ""oh, I feel like shit but I can still go to a therapist and fix myself"". It sounds stupid but made me think there's still hope for me to get better.

Well, the worst case scenario became reality and therapy made me much worse. I know she had good intentions, but I couldn't help but take it in the worst possible way. I had to put down my 18 yo cat that had kept me from killing myself since childhood and she was shocked when she heard that I was mourning my cat's death more than losing my 2.5 yo realtionship (yeah that relatioship didn't last). It honestly made me feel like the worst bitch that ever walked this planet.

Therapy also managed to destroy my little comfort bubble which was believing in the law of attraction and even altruism. I always knew I was delusional, but honestly even if I didn't fully believe it, it gave me hope that if I think happy thoughts maybe something positive  would come my way. And with altruism, she also told me that there's no such thing, becasue everything people do is for their own benefit. I'm also a maladaptive daydreamer and didn't get any advice on that other than treating it as ""meditation"". Then I got diagnosed with depression but I never went to pick up the meds or see her again. I'm terrified things can get even worse.

I heard I'm delusional before but I gave her so much power she actually affected my beliefs. And now here I am, miserable, ""meditating"" for 8h a day, starving myself because I haven't done anything to earn food, my ""happy thoughts"" replaced with plans on how and when I will kill myself. I don't want to die, but I can't take it anymore, I'm helpless and I doubt the damage is reversible."

Over the last few months, I have undergone some serious changes in my life. I quit all forms of substances aside from caffeine (quite frequently) and alcohol (1-2 times a month). I have switched my exercise routine to involve more cardio and higher reps. I have started taking supplements and cleaned up my diet. I have begun writing extensive, daily journal entries. I read more frequently (but still not as much as I'd like to). I train jiu-jitsu 3 times a week. I have lowered my mindless scrolling on social media. 

I am wondering what else could set my mind on the right track. I am wondering if I have permanently damaged my brain with my previous drug usage. I am wondering if my supplement intake may be causing more harm than benefits.

I am struggling with time management; I aspire to do more with less time. My social network is very limited because I seem to drive people away with my existential issues, depressive mindset, and personality. I have an imbalanced goal:action ratio. I, currently, do not have a therapist. I moved back in with my family 2 months ago. I work as an arborist. I am battling with my spirituality. 

What do any of you have to say about my situation? All thoughts would be appreciated, Reddit. Thank you so much and take care!"

Either I'm late, or my drawer was off for some reason I can't comprehend, or I'm not calling enough people over to be helped. Every single meeting is asking me to make commitments to improve.  


My leads know I struggle with bouts of depression, that my ADHD is something I battle every single day no matter how good my mood is, and that my anxiety comes in completely without warning. Still, they have to hold me to the same standard as everyone else. They want commitments, solid ideas I'm trying to improve.  


I have no fucking idea how to improve. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I feel like I'm there doing my job, then all the sudden I fucked something up, and it fucks over the member I helped, and it fucks over the branch, and it fucks over my numbers. Every deliberate attempt I make to improve results in me doing WORSE. More fucking outages, more check adjustments, whatever.  


Then they bring me into the office and tell me it's ""unacceptable"" and that they need to be able to depend on me, but right now they can't. I CAN'T FUCKING DEPEND ON ME EITHER. I don't feel like I have control over anything. Every fucking commitment I've given was little more than lipservice to get them off my back and now I'm out of that too. I'm not a very outwardly emotional person at all but I still almost had a mental breakdown in my last meeting because I legitimately didn't know how to fix any of it.  


I'm gonna lose my fucking job because I'm completely a slave to my mind and whatever bullshit it wants to take me on. I've worked at this job for 4 fucking years and I'm getting paid less than the new hires because I've never been off write-up long enough to have a pay raise approved even after they raised the base rates for new hires. But at the same time, there's no desire to go somewhere else. There's no end goal. There's just fucking myself over every day in a loop.  


I'm just tired man. I don't want FMLA either because that means I'm not getting paid, and if I get paid less, that's less to put towards my hyperfixations which are the only thing that keep me going. I just want to be able to function. I want just being at work to not feel like I'm giving it my all just to be in that fucking chair for 9 hours.

For context, I was on Zoloft for 6 1/2 years and I am currently in the process of quitting with the guidance of my therapist and psychiatrist. It’s hard, just as hard as it was in the beginning and sometimes unbearable. But, there are also times where I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, I’m not emotionally numb, I’m actually feeling things, and it’s refreshing. However, trying to explain this to my friends and family has been so confusing, they expected that once I stopped taking my medicine that everything would be okay, that I wouldn’t continue to feel sad. It’s frustrating but I remind myself that I have to be patient with them because they aren’t feeling what I’m feeling, so how could they know. 

At the same time, I’ve been dealing with feelings of loneliness, it will not go away. Every morning I wake up, every night I go to sleep, it’s looming over my head. I feel like no one is really there for me. They may say, “I’m here for you” but when I reach out and try to be vulnerable, it doesn’t seem like they want to listen or put in effort into understanding. I know I’m not the issue, I’m a fairly quiet person and when I do talk to my friends it’s never only about how I feel.

Anyways, I’m going to go back to cleaning my room but it was nice to type this all out. Hope all of you beautiful souls are having an amazing day <3"
3185,I shouldn’t been the one aborted,w3bpxa,notsoobviousok,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w3bpxa/i_shouldnt_been_the_one_aborted/,1,depression,False,"I was adopted when I was super young, like a couple weeks old. While I did have a family adoption I’ve never felt like anyone actually wanted me. I’m sure my bio-mom never wanted me , she was 13 when she gave birth to me so I don’t blame her for not wanting a child, children shouldn’t raise children. When she was a little younger she was able to get an abortion but with the second pregnancy our family said no. Throughout her pregnancy she abused drugs and alcohol and would run away consistently. Pretty much did everything to try and rid her self of me, she should’ve tried harder. I was born a super premature baby. And she was unfit to care for me, and she abandoned me. Once I was adopted by family ( knowing what I know now, it was a very reluctant choice) I just grew up feeling like a burden at every step of the way. If I did things right, it was good enough and I should’ve done better, if I did something wrong I was just punished, I was hit, spat on at one point verbally abused, made fun of and completely diminished as an individual. My feelings very mattered and everything I did was wrong. Going away for college was my only peace but now since graduating a couple years ago, I still don’t make enough to live on my own and had to stay at home. I work 5 days a week ( sometimes 6) and 10 hours a day. I know it sounds like I should make enough money but I feel like my drowning. I’ve got credit card debt from helping my family over the years and student loan debt and I see no way out of any of it. I’m not a candidate for bankruptcy and student loans stay anyway. I feel like I’m drowning above water constantly. Anything I do at home isn’t good enough and I feel like nothing I do at work is good enough, I think I just feel like I’m not good enough and I don’t know if I ever will be. I never get a break to just breathe. I’m so weak , if I was strong enough I’d end it. I wouldn’t plague my family with my presence. I know I was never wanted and I’m sorry I was born, I’m so sorry. I’m very sorry. I know I’m not loved, I know I’m not needed and I don’t know why I keep trying to feel wanted. I don’t even know why I’m saying this I think I just need to talk to the void."
3186,Forcing yourself to stay awake/live at night (specifically during a heatwave)?,w31jj8,springcrows,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w31jj8/forcing_yourself_to_stay_awakelive_at_night/,3,depression,False,"I’m not too sure how to bring this up nor if this is the best sub for it (I legit don’t know, I’ll explain below but I am thinking simultaneously self harm and/or autism reasons for it)

I dealt with a decade long depression and many more issues throughout but for the past few months/years I have been stable and recovered or almost, both from depression, self harm, ED and what feels like slightly(?) my autistic burnout from 6 years ago. But lately I’ve been feeling pretty bad again because of different things (and stressful ones). Not as bad as I used to, at all, but still not doing great or as great as I normally would. Anyway, this is for context.

Now the main topic. Heatwave. We’ve been having 35-40°C for the past week and more, and it's nowhere near ready to stop (nor even rain to help a bit). My room is facing the sun all day and I have a roof window that retains all the heat, which means my room gets SUPER hot during the day (and barely cools down during the night). I am also very paranoid of storms and rain leaking (as I’ve had some in the past), and even if it did rain, I wouldn’t feel comfortable leaving it open like you could with a ""normal"" vertical window (so, if it rained during the night, basically trapping myself in the heat room). The thing is I am legit getting physically unwell from being in the heat for so long, but I am kind of stubborn wanting to stay in my room most of the day because, well, I like my own room, my pc and the room to pace around during the day (don’t ask lol). Still I try to go downstairs sometimes but I miss my room so I often go back to it.

Because of that I’ve been seriously considering living at night, and forcing myself to stay awake until at least 6-7 am. Now normally I sleep around 10 hours (we’ll say 00-10:00), I sleep fine, meaning I don’t wake up a lot and all; but I can’t remember if I’ve had any issues sleeping in my life. Like, if I fuck up my rhythm right now (let’s say 7-17:00) will I be able to pick it back up as it was when the heatwave is over or will I really struggle? Also might that mean I will sleep way more? Idk (these are kinda rhetorical question), but don’t know if I can risk it.

Also I feel stupid because obviously sleeping during the day would mean sleeping when it’s even hotter aka maybe no sleeping (because I won’t have any better way of cooling than I currently do), but idk, the thought of living at night is still more appealing so I can’t think rationally. But I’m thinking, is this my autistic rigid way of thinking that’s saying « hey, the day is unbearable so obviously let’s live during the night and sleep (pause life and be in a coma (if I manage to sleep)) for the most part of the day », or if that’s the depression saying « hey, night is so much more calm and no one will be up to bother you, and during the day you’ll have to interact with them way less » (and also kind of a self harm/punishment of not sleeping like I’m used to way in this case). I just can’t distinguish.

So I was thinking, has that happened to anyone? I feel like doing it but I’m too afraid of fucking my schedule, not being ""well enough"" to meet up people during the day if I have to, and also being a disappointment to the people I live with (they have very rigid unwritten rules for awake time); but also, as I mentioned, I’m feeling kinda relapsy-ish and can’t seem to really care what people think nor what I do to my health. So I don’t know. aaaaaaa I hope this makes some sense to even just one person."

I've been a sick kid as long as I can remember. I was a premature baby so i was susceptible to this lifestyle anyways. I would always at the doctor's, ERs or the nurses offices getting something looked at or checked. It also didn't help that I was also a larger kid. I used to get teased alot by not only classmates but my family as well. My parents hated that I was big and wasn't like my siblings do they forced to participate in ""fat camp"" like programs that never worked and only caused me to feel more insecure. 
On top of physical issues, I've developed some mental disorders over the years. I got diagnosed with MDD, Generalized Anxiety and Binge eating disorder in 2015 and recently (after finally being fully evaluated) got diagnosed with C-PTSD. I've been in therapy the past year and I love my therapist and my psychiatrist. I've also been on this journey to try and get weight loss surgery done but since I've been spiraling alot since my grandfather's pasting back in October, it's been extremely prolonged. I've been trying to keep up with my meds and life but it's really beating my ass. I tried to check myself into an inpatient facility but I didn't reach the requirements to get admitted and the outpatient program completely overlaps with my work schedule.

Long story short, my life is a mess and I'm really trying to work on myself and feel great in my skin and finally be healthy but I don't know what to do anymore to help myself. Nothing is really working and no one is really understanding the mental tug of war I'm going through. So I'm just reaching out to hear some of your stories on how you deal with your own situations and maybe that will finally help me?"

I can’t stop thinking about suicide. My boyfriend died around two months ago in an accident. We were living together and I was the most happy person in the world with him. Before my relationship with him I was struggling with depression but he helped me so much that I wasn’t sad anymore thanks to him. 

We got a lot of plans for our life together, travel, make a family, business together, kids, pets, plants, everything, and now he is gone and I’m alone once again. 

I don’t want to be with anyone else. I’m 29 years old and I’m very tired of people telling me that I’m to young and I will find love again. No, I want him, I am so deeply in love with him. 

All of my past relationships before him were toxic shit. I don’t want any of that again. 

My mother also died 4 year ago, I thought I wouldn’t experience a worse pain than that but I was wrong. Losing my soulmate is living in hell. I just want to sleep all the time, I’m not hungry, I don’t enjoy anything without him. 

I really thing that happiness is only real when shared, he used to have that phrase as a tattoo in his body. We were the same person, we understand each other so well. 

I’m very tired and I’m just looking ways of ending with my life. Everyday I hope something happens to me so I could stop this pain and be with him.

Of course I was 17, wasn’t taught much about how loans worked, and believed that going to one of the best schools in this country (NYU) was the smart thing to do as all my friends (honors students) were doing it. 

But I didn’t choose some big shot major. I chose Game Design. I took honor classes in high school but my adhd brain gravitated towards game programming, art, and music. Things that I have a strong passion for and could see myself doing for the rest of my life. However, my parents and some family members weren’t (actually, still aren’t) 100% supportive. They want me to be a doctor like my uncle but, like i told them 100 times, it’s. not. for. me. 

Anyway, sometimes it feels like the damage from pressure and facing current financial instability has done too much. i don’t feel the need to do other things i’ve been passionate about during hs like weightlifting, playing my sax, or reading. Also it’s gotten to the point where I’m so busy focused on my business idea and my career that even games have begun to feel like a burden. My business idea has slightly helped with that as it is something new, but i dont know how to rediscover my other passions and take care of my wellbeing again 

any tips or advice? how do you deal with lack of motivation?"

I genuinely enjoy spending time by myself and occasionally with others but I wish I had a friend with similar interests to talk to.

Many will have a surface level understanding about what I want to talk about and then I start going deeper and they lose interest. 

At home I’m constantly criticized despite being 24 and at least looking like an adult even if I don’t feel like it. I feel like I’m the glue that holds things together at home but everyone is trying to dissolve me.

I feel left out, and like I’m not good enough for anyone.

This affects me so much to the point where I will leave home for hours just to not be around the negativity. I have been worn down to the point where I have no real self confidence and I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone and I hate myself for that.

3217,How to stop being irritated?,w39i6p,Another_Man_Hiding,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w39i6p/how_to_stop_being_irritated/,1,depression,False,"Hey y’all, this is going to be an embarrassing post to make but I feel like I have to make it. It is embarrassing to me because what I am going to write about might be seen as ridiculous.

I have bipolar disorder, so I am very easily irritated. But I always feel like my irritations are invalid and so on, because they seem very small and a non-problem.

For example, whenever I am with my family, my dad always tells me to eat slow. Now, this irritates me because I do not feel like I am eating that fast at all. I guess I just have grown to naturally eat faster than others. I have done this since I was a child. To change, believe it or not, would be a challenging task, since this has been a long habit.

But besides that, this phrase really irritates me, because he says it at almost every time we have dinner, and to me, in a tone that is very condescending and ridiculing. I have to stop enjoying myself and my meal so suddenly when I was having a good time. So hopefully you all can understand how having to do this almost every night can make you feel annoyed.

I have been led to believe that a lot of things are my fault, my family is not abusive by ANY means, they care for me deeply. But I always feel like my feelings are wrong, like I am the one that’s the problem.

How can I stop being so irritated all of the time? I would like some advice."

I was chilling with my girlfriend a week ago, and it was fun and all, but then she asked “can I tell you something?” of course I said  sure. Then, she told me she has serious depression. Like super severely. Then she showed me her scars from where she had been cutting herself with a knife. They’re super deep, and bloody. I was in shock, so I just kinda held her and cried. She explained everything, how she feels super alone and no one understands her. She’s only told her her best friend and me. She is terrified to tell her parents and feels super guilty about it, to the point where I fear it will be worse than cutting herself. It’s especially hard because she’s super extroverted, and is super bubbly and happy on the exterior, but then she goes home and cries all night struggling to put her knife away and not do it again. She says part of the reason is because she feels like everyone  thinks she’s annoying and look down on her, which I know isn’t true because shes super popular and well liked everywhere. I know she’s a Christian so she would be in a better place, but if she takes her life at 15, i couldn’t go on at all. I already almost lost my best friend to suicide, and I’m just a stressed teenager.

I finally got the courage to seek treatment only to find out the office I went to is only available during the same hours I work. My fault for not paying more attention. Talking to them wiped me out physically and mentally, and going through an initial consult again is not something I can go through right now. Finding ways to get through the day are becoming harder and harder. I practice deep breathing, trying to focus on a happy thought etc. but it only does so much for a brief amount of time. The things I used to love to do just feel like work to me now. 

The reason for my post… I am hoping to get recommendations on new ways to cope. Things other might do to help them get through a tough moment or day no matter how big or small it might be. Any advice is welcomed and very much appreciated."

We've been friends since kindergarden, we ahd a lot of ups and downs in our friendship, but those mini-conflicts always revolved around his problems and him.

I can perfectly control my emotions and i have a really good way of hiding my problems, so we never talked about my emotions, that's why i nnever told him about my diagnosed depression (I got diagnosed around april this year)

I never blamed it on him, even though it was partly his fault, because since January this year he got a girlfriend

I wasn't jealous, but because of his relationship, even though we were still spending time together (with his girlfriend of course), he kinda stopped caring about me

Since he was my only friend i had no choice, but to hide my emotions once again

Shortly after they started being together i started feeling really tired and bored  and unmotivated, i stopped having fun doing stuff i normally did for entertainement 

then i got diagnosed and i started taking some pills and was regularly going to a psychologist, who couldn't help me, because at the time i didn't really understand myself either.

Since my life has been wasn't interesting and i was bored of it, i found a new hobby... Doing mini investigations of stuff that's 100% none of my business

Finding out stuff, which was none of my business by lying and manipulations was my new passion (a really bad and toxic one)

E.g. : A couple broke up, so i try to find out why by:

1. observing and making a theory
2. indirectly asking and amnipulating people into saying what i want
3. Making a conclusion and feeling satisfied

I've been making a ton of these mini-investigations until i ended with an investigation regarding my best friend and his girlfriend: ""How far are they in they're relationship regarding intimacy?""

That was my last mini-investigation and the conclusion was, that she's already giving him bj's (were all 15-16 btw)

I felt kinda guilty after that so i told him everything today, about how i was diaggnosed with depression and i had fun at sticking my nose into other peoples lives and that i found out his gf is giving him bj's, but i didn't tell him that it's partly his fault

I thought he would understand and try to help me, because normaly he was pretty chill and even though i was doing some pretty toxic stuff,  i thought he'd understand, but he didn't

He said i was disgusting and that he never wanted to talk to me againI don't know what to do, i have noone to talk to i'm lonely"

I study at University to become an English teacher and today I learned that I can't take the TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge or any other valuable exam to proof my skills because my country's president is a money-hungry murderer. If you know, you know. I used to dream of having international friends and maybe moving to Europe bc of my fascination with foreign cultures but this dream is now dead.

Anxiety is killing me and I can't even think straight anymore. People hate me, everyone hates me, all I do is cry and shake and harm myself because I can't do anything to change the situation.

All the universities were closed about 3 years ago due to covid. Then a year later, this junta coup happened. All the people stood against it, took various public strikes until soldiers started to kill people on streets in the daylight. Then we tried civil disobedience movement(CDM). It was really effective. But people couldn't keep it going for long without income and lack of job opportunities. Most people here are government workers. Some months later they just have to go work under junta government. At the same time, things like soldiers setting on fire a whole village is becoming everyday news. Students also take part in CDM. Many also joined armed forces to fight against Junta. 

I'm a medical student. I'm suferring depression since high school. With all these things happening, I'm trying so hard not to lose myself. I don't have many friends. At first we all joined CDM. And its been abt two years now and junta government is trying to reopen the universities. So students didn't have many choices. If your family is rich enough, go study abroad. If you are ready to die, pick up a gun. Else, you go back to university and study under the rules of murderers, become a partner in their crimes against humanity. Now almost everyone I know, I love, I care about are back in the uni. They know what they are choosing and they chose it anyway. I feel betrayed. I feel angrier everyday. One of these days someone I consider my best friend, she told me we can't be friends anymore. It hurts because I nvr saw it coming. And it was recently after my grandma passed away. I feel guilty about myself because I have so little contribution to this revolution and still hoping everything will be fine soon. That's what I'm dealing with right now.

Back when there were more family members around, we were a family that almost never opened up about our feelings and just dealt with our emotions on our own.

I apologize in advance if this gets a little wonky as I usually word vomit. 

I’m only 21, but it has been years - close to a decade my therapist thinks of experiencing depression/depressive symptoms and everything that comes along with it. Being a funeral director absolutely did not help, but I digress. Over that time, something has really stood out to me. 

People that surround us.

This does not inherently have to do with family, or friends, or anybody specific, but more so a generality. This could include the aforementioned, but also coworkers, or any non mental health professional. Essentially anyone that would not necessarily have the proper tools and/or training to adequately treat/aid in the assistance? idk of depression and mental health concerns.

I noticed that, more so in the earlier days when things were not full blown and as uncontrollable as they are, people would offer assistance. They would make the effort. They would care. (I want to add that “earlier days” may also refer to the beginning of that specific relationship with that person). But as time progressed, no matter who it was, how long we had known one another, things would change. 

Is that because I got to a point where saying “I’m fine or I’m good” to “how are you?” no longer became convincing? Could they begin to see the internal struggle that was forming? 

It almost became as if what I was feeling no longer became a concern for them. I get that we do have to be responsible for ourselves and can’t rely on someone else for assistance for every single minute hinderance, but it came to a point where I felt invisible. Was I there? Was what I am feeling valid? The answers slowly windows from yes, to maybe, to now no.

I felt, and still continue to feel, invisible. As if nobody cares anymore. People still ask the how are you or how are you feeling and cool that’s great. But there’s nothing behind it? Just empty words that are more of a task than anything. 

Those that I have surrounded myself have almost, what seems like, developed a façade. What they show is not true.

On top of all that, I finally got around to bringing a case report to my car insurance building so that I could work towards getting my baby back on the road (just needed the damage estimate and reimbursement so I can fix it.)

My fiancé has a court case today and he got all dressed up, VERY sexy, I'm afraid to tell him but I made out with him in the bathroom so I think that gave him a hint. Definitely buying some condoms and taking him out to get his hair cut after this...

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder about 2 months ago. Since then I started taking antidepressants almost immediately, following all the recommendations from my doctor. I told my mom about it, and she was a little skeptical, but supportive at first. She even financially helped me, bought me pills when I ran out. Her overall message was ""I don't really agree with you taking medication, but if it helps you - fine"". 
And even though the first month was tough, I'm starting to feel so so much better than I did, and I'm very grateful.
However, this didn't last for long. And I don't mean the pills.

It started with my mom saying something inappropriate or hurtful from time to time(regarding me taking antidepressants). I tried to be understanding and didn't take it to heart. Keep in mind, she's very religious, and she also knows that I'm an atheist. But she chooses to ignore that and say stuff along the lines of ""we should take you to this amazing church, it has a holy river nearby, I think doing that will help you more than this poison you're taking"". Which, obviously, was very shocking and hurtful, I felt so betrayed. I immediately felt extremely distanced from her. 
But it kept getting worse. The next time we talked, she told me she's going to take me to this church, wether I want it or not (I'm fucking 19 by the way). She also said ""I'm not going to buy you any pills anymore, so don't even ask for it"". 
That shit hurt so bad. 
This person that almost always supported me, and the person I love so much is saying something like that to my face and being so smug and proud about it. She knows that I don't earn that much (I'm preparing for very important exams and I work part-time), she also knows that you can't just stop taking antidepressants, that it takes almost months to get off of. 

And even then, I thought, okay. If that's the way you want to go about it, fine. I'll work extra hours if I need to, I fucking care about myself.
But it just keeps getting worse. I was supposed to have an appointment with my psychiatrist today and it got cancelled (not by my choice - long story), and everyone at the clinic was very rude to me. I felt very hopeless and destroyed. I need a prescription to continue taking pills cause Im running out, and the next appointment is next month. I just came home, kinda fucked up after this day and all I hear is: ""well this is a sign that you should stop taking these horrible pills"" and my stepfather said ""all these doctors are fucking morons, you should be happy that you didn't get to go"".

Now I'm laying down, crying in bed feeling extremely fucked up and hopeless. I just want to end it all. End this suffering, abuse, depression. Everything. How do they not understand how they're making everything so much worse for me.

I can't fucking take it anymore."

Working out has been my saving grace for the past 8 years and I want to encourage anyone who is battling depression to give it a try. When I am say benching or squatting a heavy weight, I envision the things that are bothering me and it’s almost like I am in a physical fight with those things. Whether it be emotions or situations that are getting me down, I feel like I am fighting back against them. When that weight goes up or even if I fail the lift, I get a sense of respect for myself and relief for fighting back. Idk if anyone else has experienced this but it makes the rest of the day so much better. I was terrified of what people thought about me when I first started working out but that fear decreases over time. I hope this encourages someone to give the gym a try. I wish you all the best!"

He says that he is VERY different from 99% of people, is clinically depressed (apparently), feels broken inside, is so far along with being depressed that he now says that he lives life for others, has 0 expectations from people, says that his moral compass is broken, says his mindset is broken (how can a mindset be broken??). He also says that he would never walk away from a friendship no matter what the other person did. He says that he will always treat people well even if others treat him badly. He is also obsessed with human psychology and behavior and is always into reading other people or knowing people, e.g. he would be observant OF the most observant person in the room. He even stated once that he has the power to put someone else in depression if he ""raged"" but he would never do that. He is so deep-rooted in his philosophies in life that he feels the need to work on this for answers and is even shifting overseas for this. He has also told me about certain experiences of his childhood such as paying people in high school to be friends with him because friendships meant that much to him. Apparently he has given a lot of grief to his family in the past. However, the way he acts is very kind to others and he treats people with the utmost politeness and respect. He also always talks about his mind being a mess and that it just too chaotic to explain and has been so since he was young. During his worst times, he would turn to Christianity to guide him and lead him. Religious values are truly important to him. 

However, with people like this: I just cannot help but think that they are super sensitive to everything life throws at them - that these all become defense mechanisms (being overly kind, having 0 expectations, wanting to make people happy). Sometimes, it just feels like a cry for help because they can have it all - but still feel super depressed. Its because of their mindset and cognition - the way they think is super dangerous. But I believe changing mindset and happiness is also a choice to which some people just do not want to take. I am in no way undermining the severity of depression and am not taking it lightly either but there is only so much you can do to help somebody. They have to help themselves first. I am asking for advice because to some degree - being around this person has affected my mindset too. How can I best help this person? Also, I was romantically interested in this person but I'm not even sure if I should be pursuing anything with them after knowing the state of themselves."

3291,Mom source of depression?🤣,w339j5,rockstarsbanjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w339j5/mom_source_of_depression/,1,depression,False,"I have little left in me and I don’t want to keep burdening my friends with my misery so I’m going to vent here.

I am a 21 y/o female that has had a sort of toxic relationship with my mom all my life. She had me at 18 and with that we became very close but I see my mom lacks a lot of maturity. 

I’ve really struggled with depression severely since 8 years old (when sh began). My mom has been married 4 times and I have been through each of those phases with her. I’ve gone through each little family life and have abandoned each one when her marriage was over. Onto the next life and forgetting the past.

We have always had escalated arguments that my peers growing up found alarming. I’m not saying these tensions are irrational when you’re dealing with family, everyone goes through it. But the way the arguments go about are what wreck me I think. It’s always little things, like leaving a fork on the counter instead of the sink. My mom tells me I’m selfish, disrespectful, degenerate, etc. I understand she is trying to get her point across about whatever upset her, but takes it to the point where I’m feeling like an absolute burden and just want to end my life.

All through highschool she would kick me out over these escalated arguments. She would kick me out and then call the cops and tell them I ‘ran away’ because I was a minor. When she kicked me out my senior year, I was 18, so she couldn’t do much about it. I was sleeping in my car at the school parking lot and using the gym showers to get ready.

I’m not a perfect daughter but I do care about my family so much and when I do make mistakes I am genuinely sorry. I just feel like I’m trying so hard to keep my mom at peace I’m losing myself. When we get into these arguments, she calls her whole family and her friends and complains about me (exaggerating what happened) so I’ve lost those Allies.

I’ve been to years of therapy, and tried to end my life a few months ago over how much I felt like a burden. My mom was nice to me for about a month after that. I learned how to calmly communicate my feelings since then but when I talk to my mom about how it’s affecting me, I’m met with

“Are you taking your meds (antidepressants)?” “Are you even going to therapy?”

This kills me. I am feeling crazy. As if any negative emotion is invalid and I can’t possibly get upset unless I’m ‘off my meds.’

I’m just feeling so broke down and lonesome. My poor boyfriend is constantly dealing with me hysterical from encounters with my mom. 

I don’t cut her off because I still live with her and I can’t afford to move out right now.  I’m paying for my college and when I tell you all I do is work and school I don’t understand how I’m fucking up so bad. I also don’t want to risk being the crazy one in the situation and ruining all of my family relationships.

I feel like I have no sense of reality these days. I may be the problem As my depression may really be making my unbearable to be around. But im am doing everything in my power to work on myself and not let this illness absolutely destroy me.Im just so lost"

Before I was diagnosed I always just thought it was imposter syndrome. I always felt like I was out of place, I didn’t belong anywhere and I hated hearing that I’ve failed or ruined something. That obviously stems from dealing with my parents who always expected me to excel in everything.

While I work, people always compliment how much effort I put into it. Thing is, I’m horrified if I don’t. I don’t want people to think that I’m horrible, so I have to do my job right. I can’t deal with hearing “hey you didn’t do this right.” Or anything along those lines. It sends me over the edge and a spiral of anxiety. I put on a smile and pretend to just move on even if they say it isn’t a big deal but to me it is.

Once that ball rolls, it doesn’t stop and the depression kicks in. “You ruined everything.” “They all hate you for what you did” words like these continuously circulating through my brain.

Any friends that I have, never truly feel like friends. When I see them I always adjust and filter according to their personalities but inside all I feel is the fact that they dont actually like me. I’m just here and they’re just being nice to not hurt my feelings.

I don’t like feeling this way but I can’t help it. I always feel like everyone is just out to use me. Relationships have always been shit cause of one thing or the other. I always feel like I’m just destined to be alone cause how in the hell can I ever truly be myself if I automatically always have this fucking personality filter on?

And if I have it off? I’m not someone anyone wants to be around. I’m quiet, empty and just a shell of what I used to be. I don’t even remember the last time I genuinely felt happy. I’m completely forgetting what it’s like to feel anything besides just anxiousness and dread.

I just want to sleep and forget. I want to just be someone else without this fucking illness in my head.

I’ve always thought about suicide. It’s a constant thought in my head. People always talk about how it would make people you love and friends sad but i feel like it would just be relief to everyone. A lot of people might disagree but my personal situations would prove otherwise - at least to me- but I’m keeping that to myself.

I won’t do it but a coma does sound nice. 

That’s a joke, kinda.

Started celexa 20mg in January and increased to 40 mg recently.

Sort of venting and sort of asking for suggestions:

Basically I am now gaining some of the confidence that I lacked for the past 15+ years - especially in social situations. I started hanging out reading at a local cafe/bar in the daytime and I've had the guts to start small talking with some of the (very pretty) bartenders there. Can you believe that? I even exchanged names with one of them and had a sort of flirting vibe from her... Definitely an improvement since it was on my initiative! 

Anyway, I just had some vacation and had no plans, but as soon as I am home alone I feel lonely. And despite it being very nice going to that cafe to read, it works best in the sun and can't fill out my entire existence! I need to be social, but I honestly can't figure out what to do. 

Part of my depression, I believe, stems from loneliness, so I would very much like to meet a girl I can date (eventually).

I would very much appreciate suggestions for social activities that I can do on a regular basis and where I can meet girls. Anyone?"

Honestly i don’t even make those sort of jokes anymore but when I’m around any of my parents but mostly him they’ll make me regret coming to see them. Today i seriously could not take it though, i was sat with my brother playing a game while my dad was making some food with me, i didn’t really know how to play the game so my brother was explaining before my dad came over, interjected and aggressively started explaining instead. While he was pointing at a piece in the game he was digging into my finger so i moved his finger away. This resulted in him yelling saying “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” And saying forget it and walking away saying something like “Stay a stupid piece of shit then.” After getting back to making food he started berating me and said these things “What did i do to deserve such a fuck up of a faggot son?” (Im not gay but i told my dad a few years ago that i wasn’t attracted to anyone including women) “this is why me and your mother neither love or want you.”, “i do so much and you do nothing. You go on about wanting me not to call or say certain things towards you.” Promptly after saying this he slammed the plate of food on the table and said “Joke on it.” Before returning to the living room. I know this isn’t that bad compared to other things but it happens almost everyday and i cant take it anymore. I don’t care if I’m ‘soft’ or ‘weak’ i cant take it anymore and i genuinely just want to die now. I have no one to speak to.

These past few nights I've been anxious and absolutely devastated and I know bouncing back off grief is not easy especially with the way my mental health has always been but this night i can't feel anything at all. I cant even get proper help because my mom would never let me, and neither will she let me get a part time job or anything of that sort. I don't wanna think of it all anymore. I just hope that when i sleep tonight I'll never wake up ever again, it's about time at this point Though at the same time a part of me still wants to reach out for help, begging me to find something to live for. My family doesn't care for me and my entire. life have always been incredibly mentally abusive and controlling. My friends are all fake except two which i fear will one day leave me aswell. Unfortunately nobody i know can make me feel any better anymore. No matter how much I vent, how many techniques i try nothing works and i feel like I'm about to break the promise i made to myself to never self harm. Nothing works ever. I just keep distracting myself with all of these games though i know that thing inside me only grows stronger everytime I do and it seems that soon enough this thing will be impossible to avoid. I'm scared of it, I'll admit that, I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to feel my heart do a little dance everytime I'm happy, to feel that flutter in it when I'm in love, to cry without it hurting so bad, to smile without my brain screaming the most hurtful things I dont want anyone to hear about their smile. I don't want to feel empty anymore, but it feels like there's no way out of it but one. And I think you all know what I mean."

I'm used to lethargy and low motivation, but nothing like this before...

For the past couple weeks, all I have wanted to do is sleep. I used to have a ""job"" (gig-working - not really a job, but gives me enough money to get by), and I liked to do it before. I was once an overachiever. Even during my depressive episode, I still wanted to do that. But now, it feels like there's a massive weight on my back keeping me in bed. I have been making a couple dollars a day at most, when I used to make $100 per day if I tried hard enough. I can't do it anymore. Hell, I don't even have the motivation to watch Netflix or play games on my phone or go on social media. I just want to sleep. I'm not suicidal or anything - I just feel so tired.

It feels like I'm at rock bottom, but I have no idea why this is happening. Nothing substantially bad has happened to me. I've not changed meds for a couple months now. I don't know what's wrong and I have no idea how to fix it... 

I desperately want my motivation back, but I feel like I'm in prison. I'm scared that this is going to last a long time.

When I was 19 I promised myself not to reach 20s cause Im scared of getting old. But now that I'm 21 I feel like I should be more responsible and independent alone.

I've recently realized how absolutely horrible my life was and still is. For context, I've suffered multiple natural disasters and seen very traumatic things at a very young age. I've seen my brother get his thigh sliced open down to the bone by a shard of glass from a tornado at the age of 3-4, I've had a family member attempt suicide at around the age of 12-13, had my brother forcefully removed from my life for a few years since the age of 10, had my mother (who was an alcoholic) force me into situations where I got highly uncomfortable and even squeezed me to a point of pain, and more. And all of this just accumulated. I've always felt distant and numb, almost as if I've never lived life in any way. I act just fine on the outside, but on the inside, I don't feel happy or sad. Or feel at all. I've always wanted to disappear. And having decent dysphoria due to being trans and fairly constantly uncomfortable in my body hasn't helped. Only recently has my body felt any form of being, me. But it hasn't really helped. I just wish I could fade out of existence. If anyone were to care about me, I just wish they wouldn't. Then maybe I could just disappear. Sometimes I've thought of taking my own life, but never have because I've had someone who cared for me. But now that urge has gotten stronger and stronger. I feel so, wrong. Like as if I'm just a husk trodding by every day and never really feel like I mean anything or could ever make even the slightest of impacts.

The other day I finally managed to leave my house to go for a short bike ride around my town, I was listening to my favourite songs, the weather was nice and guess what: I just felt even worse.

Why is everything so difficult? I just want to be at peace.  I wish that the first time I tried to go they would have let me, because now it's all the more difficult to go through it all again. 

I wish that my boyfriend was mentally sound and he would just be okay and find happiness in this world, but he has been damaged down to his heart. I wish my family would be happy.

3318,My mom turned me [24m] into a porn addict.,w1w4t3,SidSilverAndGold,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1w4t3/my_mom_turned_me_24m_into_a_porn_addict/,384,depression,False,"TL/DR: My mother would watch porn and masturbate in front of me from 8 until 13. She would also walk around naked alot and sometimes had sex with my dad in front of me. Only now at 24 I'm starting to realize the effect it has had on me and I am really depressed about it.

I have had a pretty shit life (Abusive father, alcoholic mother, molested when I was 10, kidnapped and taken to a mental hospital against my will by my Father (The hospital deemed me fit to leave within 3 days, my father was going to let me rot in there for 12 months, and as soon as I got out, him and his new wife blocked me everywhere) My father also refuses to pay for any therapy for me anymore, again just letting me wallow in sadness and not improve)) So yeah life has been kind of awful for me lately.

But recently my abusive mother just died and I started thinking about alot of her actions that I didn't really think much of at the time. But basically her and my father hated each other so they slept in different rooms, which directly led to my mom begging and forcing me to sleep in the same bed as her. Pretty quickly she started watching porn and masturbating in front of me while I watched with her, sometimes she was drunk and sometimes sober (I was 8 years old). This continued on and off for years until I was 13 and demanded to move out. My mother would also walk around naked and sleep naked quite often, right next to me, I saw her naked probably hundreds of times, and she would always bath or use the bathroom without closing the door so I could see. On top of all this, her and my father would have sex once a year or something (They really hated each other) but when they did they would do it in the open, in the bar room with the door open, in the living room (Which has no door at all) and once when I was I think 6 or 7 I was sleeping next to them in a sleeping bag on the floor, and they started having kind of loud sex, and I remember looking up to see my moms face hanging over the bed... I think her eyes were closed but I stared for a while trying to understand what was happening. 

The thing is I actually enjoyed it, I felt special that she would give me this attention but not my brother, and I thought it was completely okay because she didn't touch me. She'd always watch the same videos too (A porn CD boxset that looks like it was from the 90s) and I vividly remember the 90s vibe of the videos. She would also also ask me questions but the one I really remember was ""Would you like it if you were that man?"" to a guy getting a blowjob in front of a fireplace on a red carpet.

After I moved back into my own room at 13, I kind of just didn't even think about it much at all. Sometimes I would but only to reminisce that I enjoyed it and thinking about it turned me on too so I would ask my girlfriend if she wanted to watch porn together, and we would. 

I have kind of only realized recently I have a porn addiction, I love watching porn with friends, tinder dates, random people online, girlfriends, just anyone willing to watch with me and exchange pictures and attention. I also never really viewed it as serious at all, like it's just porn and we aren't even touching, so I was often pretty straightforward in asking people if they want to watch with me Or exchange pictures or something (I am cringing in my soul thinking about it now) and of course it would weird some people out. 

I have seen a therapist but I have told him everything BUT what my mom and I did together, I think because I thought it didn't affect me and also because a part of me finds it embarrassing as it is my own mother. I never even told any of my exes about it, though I would tell them everything else.

But now that my mom is dead and I can't seem to stop thinking about it I plan on seeing my therapist again (After two years) to talk about this as well as a few other things.

But I'm so depressed whenever I think about my mom. I'm only really realizing how badly this porn addiction is fucking me up and I hate it beyond belief. It's only recently am I kind of learning that porn isn't really 'normal' at all. I want to change and I am excited to, but my god, at the moment I'm just so lost and alone with these thoughts of my mom. None of my friends or family know either and I don't know if I will ever have the courage to tell them even after I do therapy.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just really down lately."

And my family, they love me, but in the way that a parent loves a child, not how a person loves a person. I love them, but our conversations are empty and infrequent and they would honestly not be losing all that much.

I have lost interest in playing basketball which is my favorite thing to do. And lately I have been thinking of committing suicide within a couple of months. The reason why is because I have nothing to look forward to in the future. Like having a family. I also have been thinking about my life and it makes super sad to see that I haven’t accomplished anything in life that would make me proud of myself. The partial reason for my depression are my parents because they put to much stress on me about education. Another factor is that my mom is one of the main reasons for my depression. I don’t like my mom at all but I don’t hate her but is getting close to that. My mom is the most difficult person to deal with which is why when I leave the house I am moving to different state so that I can’t comeback because I have no reason to come here anymore. And when I move I most likely will commit suicide because it will be easier where ever I go.

For me it seems very contradicting to accept or love myself while I am in therapy to become a different person. I need to change myself, otherwise I will probably kill myself one day. Society and family expect me (generally depressives) to go to therapy aswell, they want me to change, so they don't accept me how I am. It totally makes sence, because nobody loves/accepts an illness.

Then why should I say ""I am okay how I am"" if I am obviously not ? It feels like I am only allowed to love myself if I change myself. 

And yes I am not my depression but I am depressive for years so I don't think there exists a ""healthy me""."

I go to one of the better universities in my country. I’m depressed barely holding up but I keep telling myself I’m doing just fine. I feel like I solve one problem and there’s another waiting for me right around the corner, it really makes life tough for me. My dad who’s paid large amounts on my sisters education is very disappointed at the results she’s produced till now, it’s partly justified since me and my sister can both agree she’s really not put in any effort although she promised to. I don’t feel like that changes how much she matters to me, but my dad on the other hand feels she’s disrespected him by not putting equal effort into her education. He was very mad yesterday and he made it clear that if she wanted to study further she would do a bachelors programme of his choice and at that, distanced learning which would mean she’ll stay at home won’t be able to have the same interactions people who attend college have, no friends, and all the other negatives of an online college system. He told me all of this over a call (he was at his workplace and I’m home for summers), I knew that she wouldn’t like this at all, I told her about this and asked what she thought of this. She almost started crying, I tried to console her and promised her that I’d convince my dad to send her off to any university that would accept her. I should also tell you all I have nothing but hatred for my dad there’s reasons for that we’ll not go into today. I’ve spent the last 2 hours begging my dad telling him to change his decision and to let her go to a place of her choice or atleast somewhere that is not home. I succeeded in convincing him. I hated these last two hours, I really just begged a man I hate, I feel humiliated. I can’t control my tears. What really hurts more is when my mom called her friends to ask if they knew of any options my sis tells mom to cut the call cuz it’s embarrassing for her. I really just humiliated myself, only for her to feel embarrassed. I’m kinda broken right now but I’ll be ok I guess.

I’m not as suicidal anymore, side effects have started wearing off (not as much dizziness and shaking anymore).

I feel like I’m not as extremely sad anymore, but I’m sad more often and consistently. Like constantly sad, but not wanting to kill myself so much. Still a little bit. But I’m trying to work on it.

Idk. Have any of you guys taken Wellbutrin? Should I call my doctor about doubling the dosage soon? He said after 3 weeks he might but I kind of want to double now."

My stepdad honestly I can't fault him he's a top man and treats me as his own. However my life turns around when I get to secondary school. Year 7 and 8 I'm moderately popular and hang around with a few friends, however they showed little to no interest towards me and my feelings. Year 9 until 11 I started hanging around with the ""popular"" kids and got the wrong sort of friends, had many fights, smoked weed, drank, other drugs too. I was playing up at school, mom and dad used to call me a failure, my grades went down, however my popularity grew and grew, what did I know? I was young and stupid, however I'd had many relationships where I'd been cheaten on (about 4) so there on I had trust issues. After school ended, I stuck around with 6 of my best mates who lived locally, we partied every week, smoked weed the lot... I also started the gym with my main friend. I was healing myself as I was the class clown at school and physically fought with my dad over petty shit when I got home, all I could do was overthink. However a sudden change came and I was over the moon, we was at a party and I met a girl via my gym friends gf at the time. I messaged her from then on and a couple weeks later I asked her out, she said yes. I met her most days when we weren't busy, I loved it. I met her parents, siblings and did all sorts for them, cooked, cleaned you name it... she also met my parents and sibling a few times over the course of 2 months, i also slept at hers loads of times too, only then did I notice that she was starting to lose interest, starting going to parties with loads of boys and everytime we met she never gave me any attention like she did before. After a week or so I asked her about it. She replied ""tbh (my name) I think we need a break"" I said yes of course but was confused as to why. 2 days later I told her it's over because I'd been overthinking about it and I needed to get my mind off her. I went and got my belongings from hers and she tried to keep me there as long as possible, talking about things she got up to with tears forming in her eyes, she picked up my stuff and walked over ""do you need a hug or anything?"" I said no obviously, but as I grabbed my things and went to walk out the door, something made me turn around and say ""do you need one?"" She nodded and threw herself in to me and cried on my chest. 
Fastforward 2 weeks, and I'm here rn, she's still keeping in touch but doesn't seem bothered by it all, she's booked to go to every single festival this summer and is partying with my mates that I ditched for her.....

There's a friend of mine who lives in the same building and who I've known since childhood but I don't really like to talk to him because he's homophobic and sexist and has a religious and capitalist view of the world.

As a matter of fact, most people here is either sexist, homophobic, transphobic or racist or all of them, since it's a relatively small town in a predominantly christian country. There might be other kinds of people who are as diverse and as respectful as I would like but how to find them? Most people seem only interested in showing themselves off in social media and everyone's already got their group.

Considering I enjoy being around other people, laughing with them, having a good time, that is, I'm a social being just as much as anyone else, and that I need to take care of myself first, finding a group and interacting with others is part of that process. But I don't know where to start, what to do.

Anyway, I feel I have to prioritize myself above all right now. I'm still struggling dealing with my own thoughts, feelings and my identity, since I was deeply psychologically abused/censored just about my entire life.

I just can't stand people who don't respect others for being/expressing who they are.

And well, I'm in my late 20s which makes it all even more difficult as almost everyone that age (at least here) is having kids and you know, following the scripted life they've been programmed to. And even if I looked for younger people to be around with, I would just come out as a creepy dude (due to my clumsy ways and the way I look and talk) and thus would be rejected.

There's also this: online interaction is not what I'm looking for. I've been trying to use internet sparingly because I've had online addictions my whole life (in fact that's one of my main issues).

So, it feels like I'm in a tight corner, with no one and nowhere to turn to. And I feel really really lonely..."

I'm 19. I never considered myself a depressed person. I was a prerty calm guy, no worries,happy, with reasons to live. Untill i started to face the tip of the iceberg. I'm not very social. I think i have social anxiety, i never went to a therapist so i don't rush to self-diagnose myself. The ideea is that when i see alot of people, i panic and i get exhausted. I have no problem talking to 1 person, maybe 2, but groups and especially unknown people scare me. Besides that, all the social interactions i had releaved to me that i am weird and people consider me weird because of my views, and i came to a point where i don't want to make friends because i am afraid the moment i start to have a deeo conversation and tell my views on tje world and my opinions, they gonna consider me crazy. Even my family thinks that i am mentally unstable and unable to do something in this life. They want me to go to college, or go to work, but i am afraid. I am afraid to death by the thought that i need to go there, be surrounded by people, constantly stressed and scared. I want to learn trading, so that i can make some money from home and be able to survive. My family doesn't want to support me anymore, things already got messy, alot of fights, me acusing them for my situation, but deep inside me i am sorry for making them feel bad about me, and i know it's not my fault neither their's, but this is how i am. So, with all this situation, i am pretty sure i will have to move out, go live in my car and try to survive and continue learning to trade for a living. I have around 1800 dollars, it might help me survive for about 3 years untill i starve to death.
I am a loser. Look where it has come. I am too scared to live a normal life, i have all the support, but i am refusing it. Just because i am scared of the live i will live. I am very weird around people, i cannot communicate effectively, i am scared of what will be. I just came from a party i was forced to go with my parents. I had an ok time because i drank alot and it helped ease my mind. I met a girl there, we didnt really talk much, she was very beautiful and i believe she made a move towards me, she was smiling everytime i was around her and she leaned on my shoulder sometime during the party, but being the anxious loser i am i couldn't make a move. Now i am depressed, i am thinking about her, and about the fact that i will never be able to be man enough to make a move towards a girl i like.
I know, this post it's messy. But i really needed to get that off my chest. I probably will feel better later, probably not. Mood swings are kind of random. All i can do is hope for the best."
3342,Is this Suicidal Ideation?,w2xwg7,Anonymousthroaway420,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2xwg7/is_this_suicidal_ideation/,1,depression,False,"I don’t think I am historically prone to depression. I’ve always had it pretty easy and life has almost always worked out in my favor. My life isn’t perfect but I never hated my life.

I was in a 2.5 year relationship with a woman that I was in love with. Our relationship was very tumultuous. She broke up with me and I don’t blame her - we lived together for 7 months and it wasn’t compatible.

After she broke up with me, I was pretty depressed and anxious. But I had hope I could lift myself out of the depression. 

She told me she was receptive to things in the future and she still loved me. We talked most days and hung out once a week for the next two months while I tried to win her back. Then, while I was in a foreign country, she texted me that she was done and to stop talking to her. She said some horrible things to me (go fuck yourself, I don’t care about your mental health, your existence bothers me, etc). I never got any real in-person conversation for closure. 

I am devastated in a way that I did not realize was possible. I have spent almost every day the past 100+ days sobbing, crying hysterically, confused and hurt beyond belief. I am unable to find joy in almost anything and struggle with basic things like eating. The past 3 months have gone up in smoke and are a blur. 

When I get overwhelmed, thinking that I cannot handle this level of sadness and wondering if it will ever end, I often find myself telling myself “I’ll just fucking kill myself”. I find that the option to end the pain brings me a level of comfort. It’s a way of reminding myself that there is actually an end to suffering. 

But here’s the thing: I don’t think I actually want to die. I know it’s a permanent “solution” that I can never take back. I do not want to ruin my family,  and I do not want to traumatize whoever finds me. But I do use the option as comfort. 

Would this be considered passive suicidal ideation? Anybody have advice bringing this up to a therapist? I am obviously hesitant because I know how serious it is. I feel like I should bring it up so I can nip it in the bud. 

TL;DR
I am severely depressed after a traumatic breakup. I soothe myself by reminding myself that I can kill myself. Is this suicidal ideation? How do I tell my therapist?"

They're also dead inside from working with people with psychiatric illnesses all day every day. Maybe I'm lucky for not experiencing psychotic symptoms on top of depression and anxiety. It's just remarkable how much more I can feel like the scum of the Earth AFTER speaking with the medical doctors who specialize in treating mental health. 

The first psychiatrist I ever saw was during my only hospitalization 11 years ago. He was a kind man who frankly must have given me unrealistic expectations for how psychiatrists generally are. 

When I got out of the hospital, I was still a broke young adult with much more debt than resources, and I had to go to the fantas clinic in the medical district in Chicago for follow up. For anyone who has not been there, it's the last hope for mental health services for the disenfranchised of the Chicago area. It is as desolate, depressing, and full of people whose needs are not being met as you might expect. Each ride on the CTA to get there was filled with so much anxiety that I had to get off the train and vomit in one of the trash cans at a station along the way. The psychiatrist I saw there acted like she was afraid of me because I divulged feelings of rage and thoughts of hurting other people when I was 15. This is when I learned that I can't be honest with medical health professionals without being misunderstood, judged, and degraded. I stopped going and self medicated with marijuana, friends, and memes. It was excruciating.

I crawled out of the pit of depression for a while and found the career path that gave me the purpose I needed to feel more connected to the world. It required a professional degree which I have freshly obtained as of this year. Unfortunately, becoming a doctor was pretty fucking stressful, and now being one is many orders of magnitude moreso. On top of that, since May all the following has happened: my girlfriend broke up with me, I moved to a new state where I know nobody, and my father just passed away at 66 years old with no sign of anything wrong with him before maybe April of this year.  I live alone because my dad was going to move out here with me. It's just such shit. Shit all around. I know I'm in the right place doing the things I need to do to feel fulfilled long-term, and yet I'm still so overwhelmed and alone in such a profound way that I'm amazed I haven't disintegrated.

So I contacted the most accessible health service I could. I'm already on fluoxetine from the doctor I saw during school, and I just want to keep taking it. Somebody has to prescribe it to me, so I picked someone and made a telehealth appointment. Having just finished that appointment, I can safely say I wish I had just dealt with the SSRI discontinuation syndrome since brain zaps feel more comfortable than being treated like a combination of a child, an insect, and a time bomb. The provider's bio specifically listed LGBT services. When I told her I was taking testosterone, she zeroed in on that as more of an issue for my mental health than all of the everything I have written above. Nevermind that I have been on T for significantly longer than any of these life stressors. Then she actually said, ""to be honest, I'm not very familiar with this therapy."" Fucking wow.

She made sure to let me know that I need to upload my prescription information to prove that I've been on my current dose of fluoxetine before she can prescribe it because it can cause serotonin syndrome. As much as I wanted to lash out and say, ""I know what serotonin syndrome is, I have to avoid it in my own patients,"" I didn't. If I can't furnish the prescription, she _has to_ start me back at 10 mg. Frankly, if I just rationed what I have left at half my prescription, I'll have a higher dose for longer than it'll take me to see someone else. I just hope I have the fortitude to go through with actually trying to see someone else despite the fear of this exact thing happening over and over again.

I hate that seeking mental health services makes my mental health acutely so much worse than it had been. I know I'm not alone in that. Back to marijuana and memes I guess. Hopefully I can make some friends out here soon too. It would be great if anyone wanted to share their psychiatrist experiences and any success stories they've had especially after frustrating circumstances. I desperately need some hope."

You can get wrote up and fired for almost anything they like as long as it doesn't go against the fair labor act. And when people have enough with the terrible work conditions and you tell them how you don't like your working conditions you get wrote up or fired for speaking out. Just happened to me and I've only heard about it until this point and now I know it's true. First time I've ever been written up over anything. These people can get away with murder and expect you to shut your mouth and do the unreasonable with no complaints. This place is a walking EPA and OSHA violation yet they somehow get away with it.

I'm surprised no one has come in with a gun and shot the place up out of anger. They do people THAT wrong here and they can't get any justice because they weasel out of it. Too bad I can't afford to move out of this terrible state.

Every aspect of my life has slowly morphed into a failure. My “lowest point” in life has dragged on for an entire year.

My love life is nonexistent. I came close a few times…but I pushed away.

My friends, I abandoned because I didn’t have the courage to reach back out to them after isolating.

My job…I’ve been here 5 years and I haven’t learned a damn thing. While others the same age as me excelled and took on loads of responsibility, I have barely climbed the ladder whatsoever. Every day I come in and just coast, and at this point no one cares or respects me anymore.

School…I flunked out of 4 classes and I don’t have the heart to tell my parents. I tried to tell them before how miserable I was in online school, but I didn’t put my foot down hard enough.

Ultimately, all of these mistakes come down to me. I am a coward only interested in self-preservation, and that has slowly but surely killed me inside.

There’s nothing worse than being told at a young age that you are smart and meant for great things, only to watch as the fruits of your “success” grow rotten because of your own failure to tend the garden."

I feel like I’ve been depressed for the longest time, I don’t even think I was ever “normal”. Long story short, I’ve suffered a long history of physical and verbal abuse from my dad (no longer in contact with him) and some verbal abuse from my mom (I understand now that she didn’t know any better and forgave her. )

I’m the eldest of a family of 3 daughters, so I basically had it the hardest and had little to no guidance. I left my home at 18 and moved to another country after graduating high school, where I was alone. Friends came and went but none of them stuck. So I feel like I’ve been navigating life alone for the most part. 

I haven’t been lucky in love either. The o my guy I ever truly loved rejected me a month after officially dating (we had been long distance for a year prior). I never recovered because he replaced me with someone else like it was nothing. 

I then got into a relationship for 2 and a half that was incredibly toxic and left me deeply scarred. 

I feel very unlovable and alone. I have a hard time getting excited about the future. I am in therapy but the relief is only temporary. 

I just wish I wasn’t so alone. I wonder if I’ll ever be happy…"

I’ve had nothing but downfalls in my life. Stemming from an abusive single mother always on hard drugs throughout my childhood & teens. Then getting into a motorcycle accident at 19 that stunted any potential I had joining the military as I had planned because I had no other plan. Should mention being that at home life was very tough, I struggled bad in school. I also moved out at 16 to a close friends home which lasted 8 months so back home to my mother was my only choice. Gotta love being up till 5am on a school night do to parties from my mother…

College was an attempt after high school because I was scared to join the military since I had no friends or family that encouraged any other paths. But I fell through because of how much of a struggle it was for me. Then to lose my only other attempt at good from my accident. I’ve had friends around but more or less for the comedic side of my life. “With nothing good around, surround yourself with laughs” has been my motto. But as I’ve grown I’m learning more and more that my friends really are only there for laughs… no true connection to me and never caring to ask why I’m always down lately. 

I’m in a somewhat solid relationship with my girlfriend. She’s definitely wife material but my massive downfall lately with quitting my job and completely giving up has gotten her starting to feel hopeless for me. We’ve been together for almost 5 years and live together. But I just can’t get myself back together. I feel hopeless and careless towards anything no matter good or bad. I have bills pilling up and no form of income. And nothing seems to matter anymore.

I wake up depressed go throughout my day depressed and go to bed depressed. I find myself crying pretty frequently while I’m sitting alone at home. I often think about suicide and the ease it would bring my rotting mind. I talk to my girlfriend about my suicidal thoughts and she’s there and does her best to help, but she’s no a doctor or a counselor so she does her best. I love her to death & to be frank, her and my cat are the only things keeping me going anymore. 

I feel 0 attachment to my family & siblings. 2 siblings somewhat close in age and still nothing. I can’t say I hate my mother because she was my only parent. But I spite her for raising me to be the shitty man I am today. Her negativity has taught me a lot of how to take and accept offers but never to give back. I feel like a piece of trash for that even tho I’ve been told I’m a very nice guy.

Things are really weighing down on me lately & my lack to get another job and keep going is feeling less and less willing for me every day. I don’t know what to do to make myself feel happy anymore. Video games have been my only real hobby and they even feel boring now. This idea of “fun” that I’ve used to make life feel more worth living is basically dry. 

I day dream and cry about suicide. Just that alone has me scared. That fantasy has always been my driving factor so to speak. When I’m sad or down bad I just think about suicide. It’s almost my safe space. I think about it and I feel happy after 20 minutes… it’s scary stuff. I won’t say I’m not going to do it, but I can’t promise anything. My life has always been a spiral of negativity and sadness & it’s finally catching up…

Part of my past. It's fine if nobody reads this. I just need to get this story off of my chest, otherwise I can't go outside and bury her. I just can't. She's like fucking Job, or worse even, Justine. For fuck's fucking sake. Trigger warning, I suppose - all things depression.

Back in in the 2000s, when I grew up, I was the strange kid. Autism and ADHD, was the suspicion of my mother, but she didn't let me diagnose - she was against medication. I wouldn't let anyone close even as a baby, not even her, I would say inappropriate shit, I would wet the bad, I would have insane outbursts, and I would spend my time reading fantasy and sorting, not playing, sorting LEGO. I sorted LEGO in 2009, when I was 10. I had all the figures in front of me, perfectly sorted, the day my dad committed suicide. When I grew up, it was okay. It was sad, but okay. The problems grew more slowly. My mother's next boyfriend was a pessimistic alcoholic who argued every night with my mother about how hopeless this world is. She would scream back that hope is the only thing we've got, that humans aren't just bad. And she developed co-alcoholism. My friend became addicted to cannabis and went into dealing. Before that, when I was 10, he convinced me that 2012 the world would end, that Nibiru would come, or Third World War, that most people will die - what of the pets, I thought? How do we help them? 2012 went, the world didn't end, but I developed a massive fear of jet sounds, of sirenes, and of anything radiation. Now I'm a hypochondriac.

My other friend was taken away to some fostercare program, one day here, next gone. My sister kept having problems with the police. I was quiet, depressed, full of social anxiety, got bullied in school by the most popular student, hiding in video games, internet. Occasionally, my mom would give me like 50 bucks, sometimes 100, because ""it would be unfair given how my sister keeps stealing money and I'm so honest, and so well-behaved."" Yep, nothing ever wrong with me.

I got my dog when I was like 11. My mom used to take him for a walk, then, for a while, nobody. (We have a big garden but...) I fought my depression, anxiety, self-harm, all of that shit on my own, with my online friends as support. I grew confident. It was a hard battle that I've only won - like this week, if you want to go the symbolic route. Because while I won over my depression, I got friends, even a girlfriend, this week was the first time in eight years that I went swimming again. A passion of mine that I stopped doing when my social anxiety grew. Just yesterday I went for a swim again - at night in a lake, and it was beautiful. Through all this, my dog went along. My little brother. He's 13 now. He's at my feet right now - always, really. He's jealous, he's easily scared, he loves everyone, he just wants to be loved. Well. I'm 23 now.

Last year my sister took in a bunny from a careless farmer. It was imprisoned and abused. They had so many bunnies, she wanted to help one. But then she read into the science and realized how they need family, how complex it is to bring them together with the need of neutral cages et cetera. I tried to distance myself. As always, even with the cat that I didn't want because I was afraid to lose him to a car accident like our previous one. Ended up becoming the caretaker of our dog, and our cat.

Two Months later, last year, and the bunny who was happily hopping around, even friends with our dog and cat (who kept breaking into their outside-cage to just sleep with them) got friends, a brown mommy and a daughter. I called the daughter Navi - like Navi from Zelda, whom everyone keeps hating but I always liked as a friend, when I used to play it with my dad. She was so shy, we didn't have much of a connection. Steven, the bolt one who even ran after the dog, he was the one we knew. A month later - and the neighbor golden retriever sees red and murders Steven and the mommy. Navi, the shy one, ran off. We found her hours later in the garden, scared, and took her in. I cried, so much. As a teenager, I wasn't even sure I was able to feel anything. Didn't even cry at my dad's funeral. How surreal.

I told my sister that we will not give her away, not like this. She deserves rest. For a month straight, I slept in the shed with her, full of mosquito bites and what not. I read my novel in her (big) cage, I wanted her to not feel alone. She remained shy, but didn't run away anymore when she saw me. Finally, she got two new friends, both extremely friendly and not shy at all as well. One we had to give away because too many domination battles between the boys in spite of their castration. My sister moved out, and with her the bunnies.

Three months ago maybe, I heard a weasel managed to open the cage there. Navi's friend got killed, my sister found him around the house, pretty messed up. Navi, again, survived, alone. Bunnies are a lot of work, and lot of cleaning, and all this was overwhelming for my sister who has a 2 year old son. So we decided that she should go to the bunny family where the other bunny also lives happily, the one we gave away. Just some peace and love for her. She saw three friends die, always survived. And she deserves SOME FUCKING QUIET. My sister moved back in with us eventually. I was glad to see Navi again to be honest, and I knew I'd miss her, but she deserved better, and I couldn't bare this cycle of losing bunnies, even now that we had it figured out and they might die of old age. Seeing her remain alone - unable to communicate with me - unbearable.

Well. This Saturday, my cat came home - limping. Twice a year, he limps because of some fucking neighbor cat. Vet said it's fine if I wait till Monday, just leave him inside until then. Cool. I leave my mother alone with bunny and cat for some hours to go have some fun at Christopher Street Day. When I come home, all the doors are open. ""The fuck?"", I ask, and my mother explains how Navi managed to dig herself a tunnel and ran off, and during the effort to catch her, the cat slipped away. I was furious. My mother, unable to catch her saw her in the garden for a while, she hopped around, slept in the sun, my dog slept like a meter next to her. With night, she was gone - when I arrived home. We have a very cool bunny cage actually (after the dog attack), and the only way to escape it is through tunnels. But my mother didn't think of it, as she doesn't have to do as much with the bunnies.

So I couldn't fall asleep. I searched the village for my cat, his favorite spots, because he already is limping chronically just a bit due to this super-cat that beats up all the others in our neighborhood, even my half maine coon - he's probably the biggest cat in the neighborhood, but too nice and clumsy for fights I assume. I lay awake at night, until I heard screams of *terror* at 2 am\*.\* I immediately jumped off of my bed and ran to the source of the sound. What do you know, in the backyard of our shed, right where my sister laid the other bunnies to rest, there was Navi, lying stretched out - a small shadow ran off. A weasel, no doubt. I waited 5 minutes, talked to her, she wouldn't move. I didn't want her to run away into the bushes. So eventually I just went to her, petted her a bit, tried to talk to her - but she's shy. She's not used to me, never really was. So I left her alone. On a whim, I went again through the village - found my cat at his favorite spot, called him. He happily limped towards me to say hello (he's very loving), and surely was surprised when I carried his ass back home.

Next morning, I called the vet again. Asked if I want to look at the cat now already (Sundays and Saturdays are much more expensive in Germany, we're not well-off). I mentioned that he limps less now and it's obviously a cat bite, but my bunny survived a weasel attack. She gave me the whole ""they can die through shock and all, this is much more serious"" speech but calmed down when I mentioned that she did already eat some dandelions.

So, Monday, I go to the doctor with my cat and my bunny - mind you, a 12 km drive I had to do twice because I had to lend a little cage for transport from them (we can't afford our own). Bunny, turns out, has diarrhea - she has some kind of illness they explained, and it's fine, but she needs to take medicine for three days. Squirt it in her mouth. I was already worried how to give it to her, poor Navi who's scared of touch, who just wants some peace and quiet. My cat is fine, some meds, and he can go outside too - he's just lying around in this heat anyway.

So I change the location of her outside cage, pick her leaves. She doesn't touch the carrot, nor the dandelions. I give her water. Flies accumulate, and she stinks. I can't do anything for her. She just lies there. Next day, this morning, she seems even weaker. Just lies around. Doesn't move when I get her out, have my mom squirt the medicine into her mouth. She whimpers very quietly, and I feel so bad. I change her cage again to a better place, away from flies, more dandelions - give her her favorite house thingy. I'm at a loss, truly, she just lay there, hid from me, flies all around, she didn't even hush them away anymore. I figured it's the flu, and she just needs some rest, last night she ate the dandelions too... just not today.

I kept checking up on her, to say some words, get some flies out of the cage - besides, my cat started to go crazy, meowing and running around, like never before (we just started giving him a bit less food because he's a bit overweight, but I don't know... when I caved and gave him food, he didn't care all that much). Looking at it now, he only ate a bit of it, stopped meowing though.

Finally go back to Navi. She's dead. The humming of flies, and she's dead. Diarrhea on her, and she's dead. I put her up, go to the shed with her where we spent a month last August. And she's dead. She's still there, and I'm here in my room, googling ""if she might still be alive with rigor mortis"" even though I know all too well. But she made a sound when I bopped her chest a bit stronger, wanting any reaction. Air, of course. Nothing more poetic than to bury her alive, no? I don't dare burying her, what if she's still there? What if the final joke of the shitty Watership Down bunny devil decides she has to be buried alive for the joke to be finished? I know she's dead. She died alone, without me, without her friends. She is young. She was young. And beautiful. But now she's dead. And I have failed her. I have fucking failed her. I have failed her, and the other bunnies, and I know it wasn't all up to me.

You know, a few months ago I caught two bunnies from a stranger family that was away, took 30 minutes because they were on a damn field next to their open cage. It was a day after new year's eve. Never even told the people. I know I should have, but I was too shy. Three fucking months ago I was the only one at one of Berlin's biggest train stations who gave a damn about this songbirdy lying on the ground, right in the middle of everything, wings stretched out. Came too late to my internship, but I caught it, while it got weaker, so weak even it had to rest its head by putting its small beak on the floor. Some people came: Oh no, it's sick, gotta take it to an emergency station. Can you do it?, I asked. I'm new in Berlin, I'm from Munich, damn it. No clue about any place. No, they gotta go to work. Seeing the sick birdy I decided to put it under a tree in a bush, give it back to nature, have nature decide, no way it would survive a train travel - maybe it was just shock, maybe it got better. I spilled water around the place where I put it, where it idly stood. When I checked back up on it later that day, it was gone. I want to believe it flew away.

They are save - my bunnies are dead. I can save every fucking animal except for the ones closest to me. And it was only in that moment that I realized... she was a friend. Not a close one, sure, but I cared for her. I felt responsible. Solely responsible. I always do with animals. I always fucking do. And now that I think back of her life... all I wanted for her was a family. I wasn't there for her much, not at all. Just this one month. She's dead, she's dead, she's dead, and she didn't think ""oh woe is me"" because she's a bunny, not a self-pity-loving human, she just went with it. But that doesn't help the fact that she could have, that she was so close to having this family again, a big family, her old friend. No.

Now I have this horrible thoughts about my cat. I'm worried to my bones about him. Why is he meowing? But it's unrelated. I just left this PC and went to look for him in the village again, but he's gone. I'll stop worrying now. It's just always so much. I'll have to trust him. It feels like my depression is past, and instead of numbness, pain lies ahead. I feel alive, but it's nothing but things trying to break my soul. But it's worth it. It is worth it. I need to focus on Navi now. She deserves to rest. I need to bury her. Next to her old family. I'm so sorry, Navi. For everything. Goodbye. I will remain with the others, and, I guess, help some more."

My retarded father was an alcoholic and made me just as retarded as he was. I wore makeup my senior year to cover my acne and got bullied for it in college. I made up a lie that a girl put it on me. Everyone bullied me and I was the bitch. I made a comeback the next year by joining a fraternity and clearing my skin. I did that for a year to gain everyones approval and then left. The bullying I got my freshman year was bad enough that it makes me want to go back and beat the fuck out of all of them. I allowed a lie that was humiliating to circulate through the friend group. I just wanna die and think that my life is over. I had so much potential but holy shit I think its over.

I just needed some discipline and I would have been ok. But I chose to be a fucking bitch and its over. I became my father and he ruined me. People are truly the worst and I fucking hate all of them.

Everyone I know has something going on; friends, hobbies, *anything*, but here I am: laying down on the couch staring into nothing while the suffocating sensation of my mental health drags at the core of my being. It's almost a tangible force at this point; it consumes me. I can feel it weighing down my eyes, clouding my body and psyche, and I can't take another day of this hell. 

I don't have anything. Like, I can't stress this enough: I have fucking nothing to show for myself. If I'm not in statue-mode where I just sit and think about nothing and everything at once, I'm worrying about something new. Something stupid I said a few weeks ago? Even if it's not even that serious in retrospect? Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of how that can and *will* ruin your life, so why not just end it now? Everything is so hollow too. Even the brief flashes of joy I get feel so fake and shallow, like they're imitations of these emotions and not the real thing, and when that's gone, it's back to feeling nothing at all. But even when I feel nothing, it's like my depression is this constant looming force. I can't describe it, but I don't think I have to.

I just keep wondering: why not do it now? And I would do it now if the only method I had at hand right now wasn't just plunging one of our dull kitchen knives into my chest, but even that seems like a tempting offer now. 

I'm so tired of being stuck like this. Everyone around me is growing and changing and exploring all these new fun experiences while I'm still here. I've done nothing.

Everything was pinned to them. All of my needs for validation, attention, and worth were met by them. They're gone. They left a year ago, and *everything* has gone with them. I'm not who I used to be—or maybe I always was like this—and now that I've been stripped of them, everything is on full display. Yeah sure, I felt terrible when I was with them—my piss poor mental health didn't just spawn because I lost two people I clung onto like a wet swimsuit, it just got harder to ignore it—but their attention helped to alleviate some of the pain. I was so naive to pin all my hopes on these two people, these two friends, but I did, and now I have to live with this constant yearning for something that‘s now so far out of reach. 

Why can't I just be happy? What did I do to be trapped in this purgatory? I haven't felt genuinely happy for at least a year now. I can fill my day with as many little distractions and tasks as I can, but it never changes. I have no friends; no *real* friends. I have no ambitions. I have nothing but me. I just want somebody to fix me, enable me; I don't care anymore. They can treat me like shit; I don't care; I just need someone to be there because I can't take another day of this by myself. They can be some mustache-twirling villain for all I care. I just need to have someone put their eyes on me so I don't feel so alone. They can call me disgusting; they can tell me how filthy I am or how much I burden their lives; all things I already know; all I need is one person to guide me through this labyrinth. 

I can't even word this ungodly feeling properly and I'm just praying that anyone reading this knows what I'm talking about so it doesn't just sound like I'm bitching, which, yeah, I probably am doing, and yeah, writing this down doesn't alleviate this feeling in the slightest because I can't figure out how to word what’s even going on without vomiting this disorganized mess of poorly phrased emotions.

I just keep thinking, ""What if I took couple more pills during my previous attempt?"""

Now, i know it's weird, but for me, it helped that I was talking to a foreigner.

And not only it was a foreigner...but also...it was a person that shared most of the same problems and personality traits as me.

And we really connected, and we really became friends. We opened up traumas and stuff we never shared with anyone.

I really did share things that I haven't shared with anyone and idk, i know it 's pathetic to connect with someone you don't  really know and is  basically a...stranger, but I did, it really felt like a ""real world"" friendship, you know?

I kept saying that I'd love if we stay in touch and that them deleting their reddit randomly is a big fear of me.

I wasn't afraid of our communication fizzling out, but I just wanted to..have a friend that I can chat at least once a year, you know? At least to know that ""hey, i can wish a happy new year to someone! That's great!"", as pathetic as it sounds

I feel like I’m trying so damn hard to escape this depression and this constant urge to end things, but to no avail. I’ve done the things— I do the things. Within the last year: I went to therapy, got put on medication, went to the psychiatrist, went in-patient for a week, moved back w/ my parents, got another job, made more art, started cooking more yummy dishes, enrolled in school for this August- but I still feel like shit. And I told anyone who would listen that these pills were not for me, but nobody listened, so I stopped taking them like 2 weeks ago. I feel like a failure and I’m scared- terrified- that everyone is just going to give up on me. And I’m so fucking sensitive and emotional that it becomes a burden for others to handle. And I’m scared that I’ve fallen in love with suffering, but in my head, I am trying my hardest to not feel so low, but what if it’s all just for a damn good show??? Because hell, I know I can put on a good one. I just don’t want someone to find me dead or have the attempt be just an attempt and have to live with any deficits I may incur because they’d rather me a burden of a person than a dead one, for some odd reason. At this point, pain isn’t even a concern. And just so everyone knows, I am already diagnosed w/ mild cerebral palsy, and I’ve experienced first-hand how even my mild disability is an inconvenience and disgusting to more people than I’d like. I don’t know what to dooooooooo. I have a psych appointment tomorrow and a therapy session on Friday and I might cancel both tbfh, Bc all this just seems in vain. I know the problem is me and I think I’m beyond help and I don’t see how others can help fix me if I am indeed in love with being so utterly miserable. Anywhooo, I hope y’all have a good day tho!"

Anyways I have been dealing with depression heavily for the past several months, after it built up from years of so much shit going down. 

Finally my mental health is back on the rise and I am feeling like my self again which hasn’t happened in so long. But there is still one factor I can’t seem to get over, that is how alone I feel. I have been in two relationships with others and felt things that made me so happy, and now that they are over I just feel alone like there is no one that I can talk to who just likes me as a person, someone who always thinks the best of me even when they are wrong, my mom was the person before but isn’t any longer. My dad is… I’m not getting into that. I just wish someone would come into my life who I could make happy because that seems to be the only way I can derive any sort of purpose for my life, because I don’t want people to hurt like I have from others or from themselves, I want them to be happy and like themselves because they deserve it.

Anyways I guess I just wanted to rant and maybe hope that someone had something to say about me. But don’t give me pity I don’t want that, give it to someone who needs it more."

Nobody ever has. I've always just been a punching bag, not for bullies in school, but for my family. They want me to just ""move on"". I have tried. But I am constantly ran through the mud time and time again, how many times do I have to move on before I am allowed to be happy? It isn't moving on anymore, it's just tolerating. It's not fair at all. Why has my family subconciously agreed to make me this way? I will be alone forever, the only time anybody will ever take what I say with an ounce of genuinity is the day I die.

I’m in my 30’s, and I realistically have a good life. Compared to other people, I don’t have a lot to complain about… and yet, I still can’t seem to find fulfillment or happiness.

I have that feeling of, “I never asked to be born, so why do I have to keep living this life that I hate.”

I hate my job, and I don’t have the skills or qualifications to do anything of any real value to society. Or, at least, nothing that makes me feel proud or happy to wake up in the morning to go to work.

The only thing that gets me out of bed is knowing that I have to take care of my dog because she is an Angel and deserves the world.

Daily I think about how I’m worthless, lazy, and basically just another number on the planet that’s here just to be here. And for what?

What is the fucking point? I don’t want to have to go work my life away doing things that I hate just because, “that’s life”.

I see all of these people who come from nothing and have no support system in their life and they are so motivated and successful and I think that is amazing, but I also don’t understand why I don’t have that motivation to push through adversity, because I kind of feel like I just don’t fucking care.

I’m just so tired. And I don’t seem to have the courage to change it. I have so much debt and I’m never going to be able to get out from under it unless I continue to work these jobs where I am killing my body and surrounded by awful, toxic people.

I can’t afford counseling, my prescription costs are getting out of control.

I see no end in sight and I want out. This planet, this society… I don’t fit it at all. Maybe I’m just an entitled, lazy prick and I need to figure out how to suck it up and move on.

I don’t know. This is my problem because I know that there are “solutions” to my issues, but I feel like the results are temporary and the juice is not worth the squeeze.

Does anyone else feel this way? I’d really appreciate some insight and help on what you did to change your outlook or what helped you to be able to push past this?

Because I’m at the point where I feel like my best days are behind me and now I’m going to be stuck in an endless loop of debt and shitty jobs until I die. So, part of me feels like… why not just save the time and the pain and end it?

Much love and respect to everyone in here and if you’ve taken the time to read this novel, know that I genuinely appreciate it.

All the best ❤️"

It was a struggle to do get the willpower to do so as everything is a struggle lately. But I’m hoping this leads to something positive… I’m doubtful though… 

I’m nervous because I didn’t get to pick who I see… it’s a man and I have bad trauma from many men. I’m scared of being objectified like another therapist I saw… But it’s the only place that takes my insurance and honestly I’m desperate since I’m so close to the edge of just wanting to end it all. I’m also scared cause I’ve pretty much become borderline agoraphobic and have ridiculously bad social anxiety… 

Even getting out of bed lately is a struggle. Leaving the house is a battle… I honestly think I can safely say that this is the lowest I’ve felt in years and it feels like there’s no end in sight.

Lately it feels like my mind is a prison. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since childhood (it was very traumatic - I actually considered writing a book if I could get the energy) but I have zero people to talk to about it. Most will just say “well be happy” or “don’t be lazy.” So instead I lay in bed at night next to my happy sleeping husband thinking about all the things that happened to me from preschool til last week - I’m 31. Everyone always said I was “dealt an unfair hand of cards” but nobody ever offered any solution…

I honestly think that if it wasn’t for the fact that I needed to pay bills (I work for myself and literally make just enough to cover rent and bills lately - like just scrape by and pray my other half doesn’t notice since we keep separate finances) that I would’ve never taken this step. But I really hope this person hears me out and actually helps me…

I just wish I could be fully honest but I’m scared of them holding me against my will if I was truthful about how I’ve been thinking lately…  I can’t tell them I used past depression/anti anxiety meds to try and OD… or the thoughts of not wanting to go on that always dance around in my brain at any given moment…

Every day is a new struggle. 

Every day is a new stress factor. 

I’m just done. 

I’m exhausted. 

It’s been like this for years. There haven’t even been any peaks and valleys. Highs and lows. It’s all just been lows with blips of happiness that are so extremely fleeting. 

I’m a stressed out single mom that can no longer make ends meet. I’m working a full time job. And soon to start another job. But in the meantime it’s a struggle putting food on the table.

I’m angry all the time. 

I no longer sleep more than 2 to 4 hours a night and even when I sleep it’s simply because I’m too exhausted to stay awake. 

I’ve tried so many ways of making money. I’ve applied at so many places and been rejected by most of them. I can’t donate plasma because I’ve got no good veins. I can’t sell my body because I can’t even give it away for free. 

I’m lonely. 

I’m frustrated. 

I’m sad all the time. 

I’m failing my children and setting such a shit example for them. 

I’m drowning in debt and I will never get ahead. 

I’m invisible and no one will see or read this.

Not in the way that some people get depressed for a little while and get over it I mean I have a genuine mental illness when it comes to depression. I've been depressed since before I ever even had a reason to be depressed. I wrote my first (and so far only) suicide note in the third grade and when my teacher found it and showed my mom it broke her heart so I tried my hardest to repress these feelings for a long fucking time to make sure I don't hurt anyone the way I hurt her with that note. But anyway I just want to focus on what's going on with me right now, just thought I'd give some context as to where my depression comes from and how long I've been struggling with it.



My life right now is a complete and utter mess. all the events that happened leading me to this point in my life started about 2 years ago. I was 17 years old and my mom had decided to start dating this guy that she met through fucking Facebook dating of all goddamn places and he was  and still is a complete and utter fucking loser, but I was too distracted with my new relationship to realize what was going on between him and my mom. I had started dating this girl who at the time I thought was the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my life. She was funny and a giant fuckin nerd like me and she was genuinely a very beautiful woman I was honestly surprised a weird looking guy like me could get with such an amazing woman like her.


However not too long into the relationship things started to go south because if the both of us. I'm not gonna sit here and lie and act like I was perfect, because I most definitely was not and I made a few mistakes in our relationship aswell like when I was caught watching porn and how I grew more distant towards the end of our relationship because of the way things where going. But she was overall just horrible to me. She would cut herself in front of me after I would do something stupid to upset her (nothing major just minor things like say the wrong thing in front of her or not want to do something at that very moment at that specific point in time etc etc.) She would try to make me do things I wasn't comfortable with like have someone fuck her in front of me or try to finger her in her mom's car while she was inside of someone's house or fuck her in public or just other shit like that. I remember this one time I was teasing her over this girl she was following on Instagram because I knew she was bi so I was teasing her for following girls i knew she thought was cute and she threw her hand over my mouth, told me to shut the fuck up and that she wouldn't be dealing with my shit. She later told me that she only did this because she liked the sense of power it gave her to have so much control over me and tried to guilt trip me when I told her how uncomfortable that made me feel.


Anyway after some time we ended up breaking up  literally a day or two after my 18th birthday. Talk about one helluva birthday present right? But anyway I knew it was for the best but I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss her after we broke up and still miss her even to this day even with everything she's done to me both during and after the breakup. The breakup wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was that someone who was once my best friends (literally someone I would have taken a fucking bullet for in a moments notice) started fucking her not even a full day after we broke up. If it stopped at that I would have been able to forgive him but it didn't. When I tried to talk some sense into him and reason with him he just sent me a picture when they where cuddling in his bed half naked and that honestly fucked me up for a minute. He justified all this because some gross ass bitch who he was with before he started dating my ex lied to him and told him we had sex when you literally couldn't pay me to touch that whore. This whole town I'm in has probably had a turn inside that woman and you would never catch me with his ex in anyway sexual whatsoever. But anyway a few months after this they got married which shouldn't have broke me the way that it has for so long but it has ultimately broken me for a while now.


The worst part about them getting married was the guy was so deeply involved in my friend circle that I didn't even want to go around the for a while even though I knew that they respected my wishes to not be around him and they where all on my side during everything that went down. The reason I couldn't hear to be around them was because he was quite literally related to all of them other than one of the guys. He was cousins with them all and I knew if I was going to be around them I was bound to hear about him at some point and I also knew nobody wanted to deal with the drama and I felt like me being around them would have created drama in itself.


Around this time was when I started to notice things about my mom and her boyfriend. I noticed how toxic they're relationship was and how awful it was to be around them. He would cause fights, throw shit around the house, freak out on me and my mom and sister, and once even just punched me square in the face because I called him a tweaker and that hurt his ego just a little too much. He was bringing meth into the house and smoking it everywhere freely without a care in the fucking world. I swear this fucking piece of shit had no right to be in my life but my mother let him because she's just so fucking scared to be alone so she'd rather ruin her and her kids lives than have to sleep alone at night or just settle for a halfway decent person for fucking once.


Around here is when I started to truly fucking despise my mom but not just because of her letting her junky boyfriend in the house but also because of what she was doing to me and how she was acting. She had started smoking meth and I was in so much denial for it for so long because when I was younger she was very anti drug and didn't want to have me or my sister around any of it until I turned about twelve and things started to slowly change but that's a different story for another time. The meth started to make her act out and ruin our relationship. She was constantly fucking stealing my money and making me do things I didn't want to have to do. My bank account was a subsidiary on her account so she had access to my account information at all times which was fucking stupid of me. To top it off she wouldn't give me the password to the account to see the activity she would be using with my money. I remember one time my Xbox went missing and they claimed to have no idea where it went for months. And I believed my mom. I knew she had fallen off the wagon but I didn't think it was that far.  A few months later I find out through my grandma that my mom was actually the one to steal my Xbox and that she pawned it. I also found out my grandma gave my mom money to take it out of the pawn and my mom lied to my grandma and told he she got it out.


All of this led to a big fight between me and my mom. One large shouting match about how much she had been fucking up our lives. I had tried talking to her peacefully about this for so long and she just never listened and all these emotions just boiled over and let loose when we had this argument. Things did get a little physical but nothing fucking crazy. We ended up getting in eachother faces and shoving eachother a little bit but that was it. Other than the yelling and screaming at eachother that was the worst it got. When my little sister went outside to try and talk to my mom, my mom fucking lied to my little sister and tried to tell her I hit her in the face. At this point I fucking lost it and went out into the parking lot to call her out on her shit I had had enough. This was the straw that broke the camels back. This was what ended up ruining my relationship with my mom. How she could just so boldly and pathologically lie to my face for long and then do the same to my little sister and tell her I did something so awful. That was when I realized my mom wasn't my mom anymore. This was when she became no more than just some junky to me. Our relationship hasn't healed since this, and I'm worried it never will.


There was some more that happened between me and my mom. I was pretty sure she stole my social security card and my ID and a bunch of other shit but by this point I didn't expect anything less from my pathetic mom. Not too long after all this I ended up moving in with my half sister to get away from my mom and the drama at the house but things haven't been much better. I've been trying to hang out with my friends in my hometown more again since I'm here but it isn't easy to pull myself up to do it. I'm so fucking alone right now and it's horrible. I don't have anybody or anything all I do is sit at home and play my PS5 all fucking day. I'm trying to get a job right now and I'm calling these places I've applied to everyday to try and get an interview but nothing is working.


I'm 19 right now and I'm struggling to see any reason to continue living. It doesn't seem like things are getting better anytime soon. Everyone In my family is on drugs and I only talk to a couple people in my family because I can't bear to see what everyone else has become. I'm more lonely than I ever have been in my life and I'm fucking ugly and stupid and don't see any reason why any person would want to love and care for me in any capacity whether that be relationship wise or just friendships. And everyday I just want to fucking end everything but don't have the balls to pull the fucking trigger. Do things get better? Should I try to stick things out? Or should I just grow a fucking pair and blow my cap off tonight? I don't even know why I'm asking either way I'm not gonna be able to grow the balls to do it. If anyone's made it this far I'm sorry if I killed your mood and bored you to death with this long post. Also sorry if this post isn't the best.

3419,What I've been doing this summer,w2lcui,Logical-Snow-1156,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2lcui/what_ive_been_doing_this_summer/,3,depression,True,"I don't want any dms btw, I am fully convinced that I will inevitably kill myself. It's going to happen one way or another.

Four times. Four times I've seriously considered killing myself, I've recently started to self-harm more often too. The last time I thought about killing myself was...sometime earlier last week (my memory is spotty nowadays so bear with me), but I was talked out of it. Today I feel like utter garbage, just terrible. I've written more suicide notes, so far I have 5. The last two will be to my parents, maybe I'll make more. I am unsure on how I will kill myself, I'll give it more thought. 

To give a few reasons to why I'm suicidal and considering suicide: I see no escape in the kind of life I'm living, I don't have that much freedom like most people do. I don't want to go into detail, but I feel as if I'm in a borderline abusive environment. But I don't know. I'm also killing myself as a way to punish myself, I don't think I deserve to be happy nor have friends. I am too mentally unstable to talk with anyone nowadays. **I really think I should be in a hospital**, but no. It is a stupid idea. 

I wish I had the ability to take care of my mental health problems, but I can't. So I've decided to end my life, a part of me wants to send out the suicide notes now, but I won't. I want to be dead by next month, or even better, by the end of this week perhaps. Who knows what will happen anymore.

I wish I was dead a long time ago or was never born. I don't know if anyone will see this. I don't think anyone cares, I just wanted to type up something. I don't think this message truly shows the amount of pain that I feel. I don't think anything I say will, I want to scream at the top of my lungs and completely destroy my room. I want to destroy this laptop, destroy my phone, my art, my TV, my funiture, my walls, my mirrors, my body, my eyes, my head, my hearing, everything.

Work a job you don’t wanna do until you retire at age 60 where you no longer have the same capacities you had at 25. Its all a meaningless exercise in futility and suffering.

English is also not my first language plz be forgiving 

I am still young I have graduated highschool but 
Had no idea what I wanted to do eventually I decided to go back because I developed a passion for human physique , brain , religion our story as a species and wanted to peruse a career that focuses on humans and human development

Throughout my life I was very obese and was often 
the end of the joke I have always taken it well but now that I have somewhat matured I feel it as affected me to such an extent that I still believe all 
the things that people has said about me 


even though I have lost almost 80lbs/40kg and have undergone liposuction and gynecomastia I am still that Fatboy ""once a Fatboy always a Fatboy""

In the past I have even had suicidal tendencies
due to an accumulation of small things especially my longing for a relationship I did reach out to someone while being at my lowest low It was in some ways a cry for help and to see if someone would miss me if I were to off myself

For as long as I can remember I have watched porn it started off harmless but it has developed into such an addiction it's scary it as become so bad I go nights without sleep Wich worsens and amplifies my lonely and depressive feelings even more 

I hold myself in high regard not in a egocentric way but I feel like I am a very strong person or so I would like the world to think but lately I have been contemplating giving in to my thoughts of being useless or giving up and just killing myself 

 In my head I will always be the ugly, lonely, sad Fatboy"
3424,It should've been me,w2kvox,EasyOutrage37,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2kvox/it_shouldve_been_me/,3,depression,False,"My best friend died a few weeks ago really abruptly. We were almost exactly the same age and a lot about our lives was really similar. We both left really bad marriages around the same time, have the same amount of kids in the same age range, both suffer(ed) from depression, anxiety, trauma, ADHD, she even moved into and rented the in the same apartment complex that I lived in. I really feel like she was the only person in my world that truly understood me because she was living out such a similar story. And beyond that she was just a really amazing person. Neither of us ever really had to explain because the other just knew. 

Last year both of us were at the peak of major depression, she really was someone who kept me alive. We just existed together. And there was a lot of peace in that. Even in the darkest moments there was a lot of light in our friendship. The day before she died we unloaded our stress to each other and I spent the whole evening with her a few other friends. Then she was dead 6 hours later.

I always felt like she deserved so much better from everyone. The closest people in her life as a whole really fucked her over. She went through things no one should have to. And she was such a kind and empathetic soul. She was an amazing mom and even though she was pretty soft spoken she was very outspoken when it came to protecting her kids and the people she cared about. Even when she was in her lowest lows she could find it in her to do things for her humans. 

I feel like she was a way better person than me. I've been pretty closed off due to hitting some depressive lows for the past few months. I haven't had it in me to be a super involved friend. I'm not shut off from everyone, I'm just hiding in my house a lot more than I do when things are going well. I am on medication and see my psychiatrist and all that, but life circumstances seem to always weigh me down. There's a lot in my life that can't be fixed. Finances are an absolute struggle, I'm a single parent (engaged to -such- an amazing man, but he also has kids and we haven't been able to secure housing that will accommodate all of us), I have special needs children, I have an autoimmune disease that causes me a lot of issues, the mental load of my day to day is always so much. I can't keep up with anything. My house is always a disaster, when I get it in order it's an absolute nightmare within an hour. Every time kids come over say my house is a mess, I'm always always overexplaining that though it looks like I never clean I do in fact clean every single day. I never feel like what I do is enough. I feel like everyone in my life deserves more than I give. I'm depleted.  And in every way I believe it should've been me that isn't here anymore. There's no reason that she should be gone because she was so fucking good. Im just an inconsistent mess. And I'm so tired of being this tired."

But even after feeling this way for so long it feels like Ive learned nothing. It only seems to get harder and I hate it. Why do I have to live like this. I wish it was a phase, a normal teenage phase but when it feels like it might be going away and I might just be normal, it comes back. Im trying so hard to convince myself I wont feel like this forever, that this cycle of feeling normal then just crashing into a wall wont continue forever. I honestly think it would be better if I never got to feel normal in the first place. It would make the bad feel less bad if it was just constant right. I would prefer that over knowing happiness and losing it. Ignorance is bliss after all right hahah. 

But to get back on topic,, whenever I get very overwhelmed I hit myself. I will smack myself with all my strength whether it be my head or my leg or just myself against a wall. I do it repeatedly until I feel okay. The pain calms me down. Its not healthy but I have to do it or else it feels like I am just going to explode inside. It feels like Im drowning and it's so awful. Little things can trigger me to become so overwhelmingly sad or upset to the point where I don't want to do anything ever again. 

This has all begun again recently and triggered my suicide idealization after being seemingly done with it for months. I know I said I will punch myself when i'm overwhelmed but besides that Ive been clean from SH for a little bit. I don't know if I would call it clean though, it's not like Im making a conscious decision to quit. I just happen to not SH and when I feel the urge to I realize I don't have anything to rlly do it with and Im not going to go out of my way to get an object that is unnecessarily dangerous.  If the feeling stays with me though I will go out of my way and buy something, which is why I don't think I would consider myself ""clean"". Either way I realize I need a better way of coping. So Im beginning to write my thoughts on reddit again.

Therapy didn't work out. Maybe it will one day. But for now Im just writing whenever I get really sad. Sorry if this is a little incoherent and a useless post. I just need to write and share. I would love to know if anyone else feels this way."

With your heart feeling so empty too, like no blood is in there warming it up. I hate crying. Or maybe it's just my depression, I honestly don't know. I cannot sleep. I don't know what to do with myself at this point. Death is really, the easiest option out of here. I don't want to face my fears, I don't feel like overcoming this, I don't want to get out in the world and follow my dreams, it sounds exhausting. It's fun to imagine it, what you could be. But as you get closer and closer to the start of your journey, you lose interest because it is not what you imagined. It takes effort and work. I must be lazy and ungrateful. 

I just want to freeze time, and remain in one moment. I want to do nothing for my entire life, until I get bored of doing nothing. Then, I will start my life. But I just am scared. Everyone seems to not be afraid and they are all caught up. I am left behind... like in every situation of my life.I want to lay here forever, and let time slowly eat away at me until I am nothing but a skeleton. The world will not disturb me. Only rotting away slowly, and blissfully. Nothing will matter then. I wish I was a piece of dust clinging onto a warm sweater in a drawer. forever there. no worries. no responsibilities. no judgments. why has god given me life? it is terrible sometimes and I simply cannot bare it.

I’ve been depressed since I was around 12 years old. I’m 21 now. I’ve always been told it’s a phase or just take some medication but none of that has helped. I can’t take another day living my life on auto pilot just waiting to get home so I can cut myself and finally feel something. I have gone completely numb and feel no joy or happiness or excitement anymore. All I feel is emptiness and it keeps growing inside me. I set myself a suicide date(today) and the day has finally come. Nobody/nothing has happened in the last month to change a decision I made a long long time ago. Today is the day. I may not have found my place in this world, but in the next, everyone has a place.

My father died when I was a kid and my mom worked alot, she is also incredibly stupid. She never taught me anything in life, well, except ""Always play the powerball"" and dumb things that don't matter.

There are several things that she has and has not done for me that always get me upset. For example, not one time in my life did she tell me I needed to brush my teeth. When I was a kid she would wake up every single morning, brush her teeth and get ready for work, but not once did she ever express why it was important to do. She never checked it I was doing this or told me I needed to, despite her doing this every damn day. She would take me to the dentist once a year for a cleaning and a checkup, and I'm sure the dentist would tell her every time that I clearly am not brushing me teeth, but for whatever reason she just never said anything to me. Not 1 word. 

There are plenty of other thing and it always makes me so angry. When I call her, after not speaking for several months, I always get angry and end up hanging up. I just want her to tell me she cares and is sorry for things that she should have done.

Anyway, I had an ex coworker contact me recently after I relocated and throughout the course of conversation he asked me, ""How are you?"" The way he said it and the context of the conversation it was the most genuine I've ever experience where someone was concerned for my well being. He actually wanted to know if I was doing okay in a new city and a new job. Not one time has my mother or family called me and asked me this. It felt so good I almost cried."

I can count all the good things that happened to me in life on the fingers of one hand. The rest... 

Born with physical disability. Thanks to extreme corruption in my country a surgery that is quite regular for any other place put my mother in debt and me - in bed. I still can walk and even run for a bit, but feel really bad after that, even if i just sit in chair for a long time. 

I also have mental issues that i can't treat or even diagnose - psychiatrists here don't know anything, they just say vague ""behaviour disorder"", and they do it pretty much with anyone, since they all received education in times of soviet union, there is no young doctors with modern knowlege in this field at all. 

I can't form social connections. Was always alone, changed many schools because people started conflicts with me for some reason (i always only wanted to mind my own buisness). Not helping that people in my country don't share my interests or values (living in kinda traditional society). I have no problems working in team if it's nessesary, but it's really had to become a member of such team - for example, after 17 years of attempts to convince potential employer to at least look at my works i had zero sucsess. I just can't navigate myself trough the field of lies and deception that was formed by society - in order to impress people you must always pretend to be someone else, and i can't do that. 

I also can't learn things. I have a big passion for writing stories for video games, but apart from that i barely have interest in anything else (unless i researching it for the story). Even if i manage to learn something that does not interest me - i forget it really fast. In school i had bad grades in everything but literature, and don't remember a single thing that i was taught there. Funny enough - i don't even know rules of any languages i write in, because i can't learn them. I tried to learn various things - music, art, spent 2 years trying to learn programming but now have no idea how to write hello world. It feels like my brain just deletes everything it wants to without my permission, but i still remember some of the first stories i wrote, in details. I also can't understand many complicated things. And i constantly want to sleep during the day, sometimes so much that i can't even think straight because my eyes are closing, but i can't sleep at night because of panic attacks, and now, with constant air alert sirens it's even worse.  

So i can't work in office because i am physically unable to walk there every day or even sit in chair for so long, and also can't work from home because it's almost impossible to find a job as a game writer, and there is no other jobs i could think of in my country. 

I live on disability pension that is currently 2100 UAH (71$) per month. It was kinda enough for food for me and my cats before the war, and i were finding one-time jobs from time to time. But since my country were attacked food prices doubled and i lost those side jobs. It's becoming hard to survive here, and it won't be better, no matter if the war ends or not. I only have a place to live now because mother helps pay the communal services.  

In theory, i could leave. There are some really nice countries like Norway, that provide place for regugees to live, and funds to live on. I could also get medical help there. But due to my learning problems i might never be able to learn the language so i could get a job there, if they even have jobs for people with my kind of disabilities. What would i be then, dead weight for the country? And if i won't be able to work, the social income probably won't be enough to get my cats to the vet and buy meds for them. They will probably send me back, if not instantly - then when was is over.  And even if that wasn't the case, i have no idea how can i move myself, my pc (that i can barely lift and walk to another room with), my cats, their food and other items to another country. Not to mention that i don't have funds to go to another town, let alone country. And even if all that wasn't the case, my country still won't let me out, i asked a local lawyer and she said that people with 3-nd disability group are unable to leave. I am not sure why my government is doing that - i can't fight the war for them, they don't have any jobs for me, but i still cannot leave... 

So here i am - unable to do something meaningful in life, unable to find people to spent the life with, unable to leave in search for place where i could improve my life at least somehow. There is no place for me in this world, but i can't end my life either because my cats depend on me, and they are the only creatures in the world who ever wanted to hug and cuddle with me, so i need to take care of them. Every day is full of pain - both physical, because i can't afford medicine, and mental, because i know that things will only get worse. I feel trapped in this nightmare, and there is only one way out - to die from old age or some disease, or hope that russians will bomb my house, but before that happens - how can i endure all of this?

I don't even do anything I enjoy, I usually just chain smoke in silence. I wake up around 11 AM and then work all day until 8 or 9. (Usually from home)

I keep telling myself I will switch everything around and that I will feel happier during the day, but I'm never able to do it. I realize that I am subconsciously using the night to hide from the world.

My wife is pregnant with our third daughter. She doesnt want more kids after this so I am coming to terms with the fact that I will never have a son.

I can't express this to people I know without feeling guilty. I feel guilty even for feeling this way.

3446,Really appreciate anyone who listens,w2fcui,Regular_Reality_7845,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2fcui/really_appreciate_anyone_who_listens/,3,depression,False,"hello, honestly i’m really bored so i thought i’d share this to see if anyone has any opinions. never done anything like this but my situation is really stressful and delicate. before i get into it i’ve had very poor mental health pretty much my whole life but unsurprisingly it’s gone to a new level now. i have finally saw a doctor and they gave me some pills or whatever idk what they even actually do tbh. anyway to start this story we go back to january 2021 the best time of my life i have a girlfriend i loved to bits everything was looking good not to say there was only sunshine and rainbows but i was finally making progress. i had just turned 18 in january and i ended up essentially dropping out of school/college (called sixth form here in uk) so i basically put all my time and energy into this girl but i was really happy and proud of here especially since she had a tough background and poor mental health herself i really believe i helped a lot at the least of things. 

anyway fast forward about 2 months id broken up with this girl and i was really frustrated and angry ect. but more importantly suddenly it was like my whole world revolves around her and suddenly she’s gone. without school or a job to add to this and the fact i had a hard time sleeping so i had like 20 hour days constantly of nothing so i became incredibly bored. so i decided hey why not go on that omegle site u used to go on years ago should be fun for a bit.

anyway i don’t know if it was always this way well i guess it was a bit but turns out a lot of weird people on there idk if cos lockdown it increased this but basically to summarise one particular person sent me a link and me being stupid and bored and i guess idk the word but i didn’t expect anything like what i saw.

it was a file sharig site like google drive callled mega. and inside this folder was like 10s if not 100s of pictures of cp. i was absolutely blown away i’d never seen anything like it i thought it was like a dark web thing or whatever. anyway i presss of it do a little bit of googling. and turns out it’s a very common way pedophiles “trade” as they call it with eachother.

anyway fast forward to like october. at this point i had like a part time sorta thing job anyway police come over and there like something inappropriate use of the internet blah blah so i tell them and they are like ok we search ur devices which was like an old laptop and my phone.

around february so like a whole year after the event they call me in for an interview i have like a solicited woman to help she tells me to just write a statement and say nothing. anyway they say that like they found i viewed 8 of the images which to be completely honest i have no idea if i did but i assume maybe i pressed on some which obviously i should not have done but that’s literally all anyway the police woman said i doubt this willl go to court ect.

pretty much a comman theme here was being told “this won’t get any worse” and then the worst thing happening. so of course it goes to court. to summarise i pleaded guilty bc i basically didn’t know what i was doing and bc i said in the interview i was guilty bc again i was heavily persuaded it won’t get any worse ect. i also didn’t wannna be like hey cp is ok guys or something.also bc of the nature of the crime it’s mandatory i’m on the sex offending list

honestly i don’t even know what to do i can’t believe my life got this bad it was awful as it was other then those few months with that girl. i don’t know if what i did deserves this alll the people involved seem to feel really sorry for me. i would like to know what others think. thank u"

3450,Clockwork,w2jib1,_SmilesSideUp_,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2jib1/clockwork/,2,depression,False,"Every day. It doesn't matter if I'd had a good day, a bad day, a mediocre day where nothing interesting happened. When I lay down to go to bed, the thoughts come back like clockwork. I reflect on my day only to remember that everyone hates me. I disappointed three separate people today. I know I'm not just making those feelings up in my head, when they told me what I did wrong. I know I'm a fucking failure and those thoughts come and they tell me that I am. I'm never going to achieve anything. I haven't done anything worth note by now, and I never will. I'm not interesting. I have a flat personality. I'm not pretty enough to be notable. I don't have any talents, I don't have any passions. 

I spend all day playing video games and sleeping. I don't remember the last time I ate a normal meal. I don't remember the last time I drank a cup of water. I don't remember what day it is, I just sleep until one PM and then go play Minecraft or whatever until three in the morning. It's all I feel like I have. 

I don't have friends to talk to that live near me, so I don't leave the house. I don't smile or laugh anymore on my own. I feel like a shell and a ghost and I want to die so badly. I just don't know how I can die. I've made plans. I haven't finished them. I'll take some pills and give up because I'm scared, or I'll cut deep but then freak out at the blood because it's disgusting and bandage myself. I haven't felt happiness that wasn't just a spur in the moment sort of thing where my mom got me a gift or one of my friends texted me or something. I shower maybe once a week, so I feel shitty all the time. I have sensory issues regarding water, I can't stand too long or I'll get sick from anemia, and I don't leave my bed. I need to exercise and be healthy but I just can't, it's like there's something stopping me, like an invisible roadblock I can't push away. 

I'm sad. I'm just so mind-numbingly sad and tired that I don't know what to do. I feel like I put out this really happy and smiley personality where I'm friends with everyone and so outgoing but inside I have this brain fog that won't go away, like I call my friends by the wrong names and stuff. I lose my train of thought so easy. I'm sleepy constantly. I'm sensitive and cry over too much but it's because I'm feeling overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. I just don't know how to fix myself. I'm fucking terrified of therapy, when I used to have it (for maybe two months) I was so uncomfortable the entire time and I hated it and I don't want to do that again, plus my parents would think I'm insane or something because they didn't take my first suicide attempt seriously at all. So I have to solve this problem on my own, like everything else in my life. I just don't want to.

I want to give up and go away. People forget things. Even if everybody around me told me they'd be upset if I disappeared, I know it's a lie because people forget. I wouldn't even be part of their train of thought in the next six months. I'm just not worth that much brain space. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to die and just kind of help everyone out but I'm too scared and I don't have the strength to do it anyway. I want to run off and disappear and have everyone stop wasting their time thinking about why I'm barely a human anymore. I don't want to scare or worry anyone but I also just can't keep doing this for the rest of my life. I need to find a way to fix it and the only way I can see is offing myself and getting it over with."

I am afraid to bring a child into this world because I am already afraid for my own future living on a dying planet that’s getting more and more expensive to survive on.

I don't want anyone to bear this false guilt. i have some ideas but need to find the safest way to guarantee success. 
i can't risk getting discovery, hurting others, or ending up surviving in a vegetative state bringin just more suffering to my family. worst case would be creating an unsolved murder mystery around my death keeping everyone from ever moving on. 

I feel disgusted with myself for thinking that. I know that I have a responsibility to the people in my life who care about me. i know i have no right to take someone they love away from them. suicide affects the victims surroundings as much as you wolde by taking someone else's life.
I think it hurts even more because the bereaved can't blame anyone directly so they start blaming themself. this fear is the only thing that keeps me alive in my darkest moments. my thought pattern wase always just keap on suffering untill you find a way out. 
Every time a doctor asks me if I am contemplating suicide or if I am capable of killing myself, I have to say no because it would decrease my chances of dying successfully without burdening everyone with my decision.
I'm afraid I'll have to be open about it to get help, but taking this action would shatter my hope for a less selfish end.

Doing things that require minimal brain power because I can't handle anything more. Or I'll lie in bed scrolling through Instagram and TikTok even though there's nothing that's particularly interesting. Eventually, when I'm tired of doing even that, I'll close my eyes and try to sleep even though it's only 1pm, even though I slept enough last night, even though I don't feel ""tired"". When I wake up, I'll still try to go back to sleep. At least it makes the time pass. When I'm around my roommate, she'll talk to me and complain about her work, her boss, her life as I give the responses she wants to hear. I'll nod and listen and agree but inside, I feel exhausted from keeping up appearances. All I want to do is be alone. We'll watch shows and eat together and joke about plotholes while I wish that the episode finishes faster so I can go be by myself in my room. It's not terrible all the time. Sometimes when I'm with my friends, I forget for a bit and have a good time but then why do I feel so much worse when I go home afterwards? I just had fun, I was just smiling and laughing so why do I feel so depressed? What changed that made me suddenly retreat back to bed and feel so hopeless? And then there are bad days. Days when I can't even bother to get out of bed in the morning and pretend to be productive even for a few minutes. I can't be bothered to do anything. I'll just eat snacks throughout the day because cooking is too much work and then I'll have to do dishes. All I want to do is just order good food because it might make me feel better at least while I'm eating it but I can't because I can't afford to do that right now. I can't even do the one thing that might make me feel better because it'll make me feel guilty. I haven't even done anything to deserve ordering food and it's not even fiscally responsible?

I'm almost 40 now and I think I've hit rock bottom. I'm not a shitty guy. I've never cheated and never intentionally hurt anyone. I'm a bit introvert and maybe too focused on my work but I've been the kind of guy who gave everything in his relationships. After 3x5+ years failed ones I've got to a point where I don't see the light at the tunnel's end anymore. I don't think I can trust another human being with my feelings anymore and I don't know how to make the pain go.   
The previous relationship I had the girl I was with for years cheated on me and I couldn't get over it. I got to a point where I was hating myself so bad and blamed myself and my incapacity to understand her and how we got to that point. With the help of friends I managed to get over her and in like 2 years I've decided to go back on the ""market"". I was so pissed on the whole cheating thing that it was one of the very first things I would discuss with everyone new in my life. I found this girl on Tinder 7 years ago who was amazing in many aspects. The problem was she was coming after some fucked up relationships and with a lot of mental baggage. Also and she was having a way of life that I could not deal with. She was releasing her frustration by having sexual relationships with every male she could find. So I said pas and moved on with my life but remained friends with her because she was a wonderful person in all the other aspects. In the next year she got a boyfriend and she settled back a bit, but it was clearly a rebound. She dumped him after 8 months and we started seeing each other more and more often. After all the conversations I had with her I honestly thought she was over the dark mood and decided to give ourselves a chance after a while. I was always a bit off by knowing her history but I've tried to open up as much as I could. We had 4 beautiful years of relationship. We got close, we were constantly traveling and I loved her with all my heart. But something broken in her when her grandpa died and from that point she slowly drifted from me. The next 2 years have slowly became just routine. I've tried to mend our relationship but I only hit walls and rejection. So, like a dumbass I am, I didn't fought anymore. I let her drift and I zoned out into work. I knew what will come. I didn't want her to leave but I also had no more power to fight. I also need to say that I was going through a rough time by myself. I have a health problem that keeps me in pain 24/7. Sadly, loosing her support meant loosing my will to get better also. I've started neglecting my health issues and make her go away from me even more. She didn't left tho...and I know she loved me more than anything in her life, but she is battling her own demons and we got to a point now where there is no turning back. She started accusing me of not loving her and I got to a point where I was not caring anymore. Then instead of leaving she decided to cheat on me. Let me put it this way....for her fucking with others never meant anything emotionally speaking and she always hinted that if I can we could have an open relationship....at least that's what she said from the beginning. It was just her way to ignore her depression and be able to function. For me tho sex without emotional involvement doesn't exist and I asked her at the beginning of our relationship that if she wants to go with others to just let me go, couse that will break me. She didn't and she broke me. I had 2 days where I was out of my mind. The anxiety and struggle was at levels that I never knew possible. I was considering all the ways I can make her hurt, I was so petty I wanted her to feel what I feel. But then I realized that I can't. I can't be that man the break her just out of spite. I spent time on thinking of the things I did wrong, on the moments when I was cold and ignored her, on the lack of attention and all the shit I did wrong. I realized that I really love her and I don't want to loose her and I told her I want to give ourselves another chance. She didn't say no but didn't say yes either. So a month and a half later we were still going through an emotional rollercoaster where she told me multiple times how much she loves me and came back home but she also hold me in a limbo and made me feel like the last person on earth. I've been discussing with her probably more than we've ever talked in these last 6 years. I've been telling her everything I thought and all the things I love and hate about our relationship. She did the same to a point but she also failed to show me that she really wants to fight for our relationship. I've started struggling more and more to function and I ended up giving her an ultimatum. She begged me to leave her a few days to think but after the first one I cracked. I could not stand the pain anymore. I told her that if she loves me truly as much as she says then the choice of fighting for us doesn't need more than a second of thought. I knew that putting pressure on her will only make her run but you know....hope dies last. Now she's on her way to come and get all her things from the house after yesterday telling me I'm the one and that she will never be able to connect with anyone as she did with me. We've built so much in the past 6 years and I love her so much that honestly I have no idea what I'm gonna do when she's out of that door. I am so hurt and can't stop from crying. 

Sorry for the long post but I've lost all my friends in time and I ended up stranded with no support and in need of venting."

For the past month I've been making a point to get out into nature every single weekend. My bf has been doing a great job of making sure it happens by finding new places for us to hike. Yesterday (Sunday) we went on our first moderate hike together, which was a five mile loop that took us about two hours. We were both exhausted and sore by the end, and I was proud of myself. 

Today he told me how proud of me he is, and how he's jealous that my legs are still sore because his aren't. I couldn't believe that he had completely recovered from that in one day. He just brushed it off, saying things like ""that's the kind of hike that I would usually run"" (I don't remember the last time he's ever run more than a mile), ""I could go another five miles if we packed something to eat"" and ""I wasn't really pushing myself"". 

I was a little insulted, justified or not, and he said that ""we are clearly in completely different physical condition"". Granted, he is a blue-collar worker, but he's mostly doing standing and heavy lifting (I know from experience that is quite physically taxing, but it's very different from running up a mountain). My most recent job was fairly sedentary and the freelance work I'm doing now IS done while sitting down typically, and I have had my fair share of bed-ridden depression days, but I do work out vigorously for an hour every day now... 

I don't know, he's probably right, but when he was saying those things, I was feeling like he was applauding me for doing the bare minimum, something that was SO easy for him. I felt like I was (and am) holding him back from doing what he really wants to do. Meanwhile I'm just an adult baby who did ""such a good job"" putting the square block into the square-hole.

I understand what he was saying. I don't want to come across as delusionally angry, but something about him hammering in the fact that something he was proud of me for doing was so easy for him made me feel almost infantilized."

Lately i have been struggling to go out and ask for help. Whenever i feel im ready, my brain just tells me im okay and i dont need any kind of help. I went to a hospital to ask for a good doctor therapist psyhiatrist or whatever i need, and i just couldnt, so i left and nothing happened..

The same thing happens when i want to tell my mom,cousin, friend or anyone really. My brain just convinces me that im okay and that i shouldnt ask for help.

This all has put me in some kind of loop, im sick im suffering, when i want to ask for help i cant..And the circle keeps repeating. I dont know if this is a mistake but my only hope are doctors and therapy...If that doesnt work out, im done. So if everyone had some similar experience, struggled to ask for help, i would love to read your comments and finally start fighting against this shit. Somebody please help me i dont know what to do 

Thank you in advance."

This really fucked with my mental throughout the period of time that we went back and forth, basically emotionally abusing each other because of all the lies that we'd told each other and wrapped ourselves up in. Then about 3 years ago, during what I would say probably the worst part of our relationship yet, I got myself horribly burned and put in the hospital for about 3 weeks, which in that time he came to visit me while I was in the hospital, which at the time only further convinced me that he would stay my friend for the rest of my life. The friendship ended up falling apart almost 2 years ago now when my step sister, (who is his past lover) got into the middle of a heated argument between me and him and basically told him to fuck off, which ended any kind of friendship that we would have in the future, or so I thought. Fast forward around 3 months, I'm wrapped up in emotional turmoil and decide to text him 'just to say hi', he responds soon after and we end up finding out that we both now smoke marijuana. A couple days later he calls me back to tell me that he wants to 'make amends and be friends again', which, again at the time I was more than willing to do. Around 6 months after this happens, he ends up disconnecting himself from basically everyone in the friend group for his girlfriend at the time which upset a lot of people, but at the same time they didn't care because it was his life. During this time I was told by my closest friend that my ex best friend had told him that the only reason he had tried to be my friend again was because he wanted to use me for marijuana since I had the supply of it at the time. I kind of expected it but nonetheless it upset me because he used the fact that I still cared for him for his own devices again when I truly thought that things were different. It's been a bit over a year since that happened and I feel like I'm doing better than I was when all of that shit was happening, but it still affects me to this day, sometimes too much. Even though I feel like I'm in a good position considering everything that I've done so far, the weight of the emotions that come with my depression just seem to overpower the positives. Ever since I stopped seeing my ex best friend, the heart sickness has been overwhelming. I've had a couple of girlfriends since, but all of them were online and all of them broke it off with me no more than 3 months later. In the relationship that I had with my ex best friend for around 5 years of that time, I was hugged, cuddled, loved and given affection by him with only ever having two encounters like this with a girl at the time (now it's 3) and now all of that's been stripped away. It was easy to ignore for a pretty long time, but then there's those times when my thoughts get to me and I started thinking about the past and what happened and the girls that I felt I actually loved just for them to leave in the end, with me literally left wondering 'Why?' almost all the time. I've done what I can to try and cope with the depression ever since it come back in full force a while ago, but it's gotten to the point where I don't know how to deal with all of it just thinking to myself 'if I had someone here to hold me then everything would be okay.' I set up a dating profile on an app that I use, but if anything the longer I use it the more it brings down my confidence because of the fact that no one's 'swiping right'. I've recently almost done some things that I would consider immoral during the times that I've spiraled into a depression and I've been able to pull myself out of it for the most part, but honestly I don't know how much longer I feel like I can last doing this alone. I know that I have friends and I know that I have family that will always listen to me no matter what I've done or what I have to say, but I need someone more than that now. I need someone who will love me in a way that no one else can, the way that I used to be loved by the one I used to call my lover. I just want to be held by someone who truly thinks that I'm worth it, who actually gives a damn about what I say and do and how it might affect my life, someone who's there to hold me even in the times that I've done something wrong and is there to tell me that it's okay even though I'm not being the brightest of places and I want to be able to do the exact same thing for them with 100% of my heart. Before a lot of things that happened in my life, I didn't really used to believe in the existence of God or a being that had omnipotent power that watched over us, but ever since I was put in the hospital and taken out three weeks later when I was expected to die the night I was sent in and after all the wonderful friends that I gained after that it happened among other things, I started to more or less believe that there was at least something there looking out for us. I know that right now this is just one of the many low points that I'll have in my life, but this time the wave hit harder than ever before. The heart sickness is becoming seemingly unbearable, day by day, but I do my best to keep pushing forward, hoping that someone will come my way and take my hand, telling me that everything will be okay. 

For anyone who was actually read down this far, thank you so much for reading through my trauma lol. It really does mean a lot to me that some people actually take the time to read the things that people have to say on this page. I came here to type this out after seeing a bunch of YouTube videos and shorts on it because I felt that it might get a bit of weight off my chest. So again if you have read this far, thank you and have a good night/day."

It's just boring and repetitive and seems like a pointless attempt to try to get my life together. I had to go to work today and do the same thing on one of the hottest days of the year and was just hoping I don't faint from heatstroke and it just makes me sad, because there are people out there that don't have to do this and get so much more than me. I'm sorry if that sounds greedy and envious.

It's a long story and I could go on for ages, but I'm just going to say I'm a student who wanted to get a some work experience at a pharmacy although I'm only a first year and the big opportunities are usually given to second and third years, so to no avail I couldn't find anything. I was searching for summer jobs after I finished my exams and got accepted into a minimum wage job after many people not responding to my job applications. Even if I did find anything at a pharmacy at this point it wouldn't be able to fit in my busy part time schedule.

I come home exhausted, sweaty and I just look disgusting all for minimum wage. It's not that I hate my job, I do enjoy it the people are very friendly there, it's just, I don't know, the way the world is that makes me feel like giving up on everything. There are people out there who have never done any sort of minimum wage job in their life and will never have to, because they were already born into wealth. I just want to live freely. I want to go on holiday. I want to hang out with my friends. I want go to expensive restaurants and eat expensive things. Take photos of pretty things and pretty places. All I seem to do is work along with some painting and drawing on the days I'm free. I've been avoiding Instagram, because I know it's going to make it worse since I follow so many people who are on holiday at the moment especially the rich international students I've met at uni. 

I'm supposed to be part time, but I'm on like 32 hours next week. I don't know if my scrawny little body can handle that much labour in the boiling heat.

It’s just that, whenever I open up to the people I trust enough to be vulnerable to, they comfort me and say that life will get better.

I honestly just want to be heard. I want people to tell me that I shouldn’t live my life for others. I want someone to tell me that I’ve done my best and that they’re proud of me. I don’t wanna hear things like life will get better because currently, it’s not. I just want someone to say that life really does suck. The world is cruel. People are mean. 

I keep waiting for life to “get better” and honestly, it just keeps getting harder and harder. I’m at this stage of my life where I find myself randomly crying and super stressed out by nothing. I don’t even think I’ll live past 30 because of all the stress my body is experiencing everyday. 

I think, for now, I’m just looking forward to small things that make life even the slightest bit easier. Hugging and kissing my lover, dates with friends whenever they’re free, improving my art, finally being able to spoil myself. I don’t think life will get easier, but experiencing stuff that makes me happy would make it worthwhile.

Listen, i was arguing with my mother because of the religion. It's actually regular, it starts with my little brother and ends up with me and my mother.
But today. Something went wrong, horribly wrong. We were arguing again but then, after minute of silence she said something mind breaking, she said that i wasn't oldest in our family... which i thought i was my whole life, she said that before me she had twins, and before them whe had my potential brother, but she had some virus in her blood that were canceling pregnancy...
Yeah, no so funny, i could potentially had 3 older siblings. But... but... I'm crying rn

My life will never go back again, as I'm writing it my hands are shaking my head is exploding, i didn't meant this theme to go that far, so when my mom said that i stood there shocked, then fall, this time I've been crying as never before... after few minutes i rushed to my mother amd started apologizing and saying that I'm sorry really really sorry and that i didn't meant to say something this harmful, I'm such a trash, idiot, retard, piece of shit, i want to kill myself so hard, but i can't imagine my mither losing her fourth son...

I don't think she'll make it through if I'll kill myself, but i want to so bad, because I'm usless worthless idiotic bastard.

My head is melting, i can't i can't, but when i think about her i just can't do it.

(Which is an issue because I blame myself for a lot of my trauma which has resulted in self hate and the inability to love my own company)

I’ve been going through a bit of a rocky period with my best friend where we had a massive argument and then we both came to the conclusion where she said she was going to help me with all of this and if I ever feel uncomfortable when we’re out in clubs together to tell her (I cry whenever I’m out in clubs because I think about the trauma) 

We went out clubbing a week after this and we went to go Mcdonalds to get food after (all very drunk) and a man was ordering on the machine infront of me. I waited behind him and he noticed and finished his order quite quick and proceeded to wait behind me while I was ordering which I thought was weird but brushed it off. He followed me after I finished ordering and was waiting with a lot of people. I switched from waiting on one wall to the other to get away from him because I was creeped out, best friend got pissy and started shouting at me asking why I won’t tell her why I’m constantly moving and I started crying. While she was shouting, the man who was making me uncomfortable then asked if I was okay (probably a good guy I was just super paranoid), I got super sad all at once and all the tears came on and I walked out to get some fresh air. She was annoyed when my friend went up to her in the McDonald’s saying that I left her with that man and it could’ve been anyone weird. Later, in the taxi, my other friend was holding me while I broke down and she was on her phone the entire time. She’s super close with everyone in my friend group so I haven’t been speaking to anyone because I feel guilty for not replying to her message after the night out saying it’s not fair I ‘left’ her.

I'm a 26 years old pansexual guy, and I have failed to find anyone I could be... intimate with in a long time. I tried various different dating apps, dating at the clubs and other places. 

I know I am at the age when my libido is the highest, and failing to find someone just makes me more and more depressed. I tried working on myself through weightlifting and learning to play guitar and synthesizer, but I know its too late for me to improve myself. 

I genuinely dont know what to do. I am trying to be a good person, I am volunteering at a charity organisation, because I love to help others. But in the end I feel like its not even worth it... Last girl I got matched with on a dating app told me that usually she doesnt mind sexting and sending nudes, but I am  ""too nice to dirty talk with"". 

Only thing close to a relationship that I ever had was a classmate I dated  3 years ago. We met couple times, I did my best to satisfy her, and then she told me that she had sex with me only out of desperation, that she was afraid noone else would want her because she is overweight and hates the shape of her breasts and so on... But I didnt care about that... I just cared about making her happy!

Since then I only had 2 one night stands, which I hated, because I care about a deeper connection. And in both cases my partner promised me that we would stay in touch, but then just stopped talking to me... 

But.. as much as I hate what happened, I miss that. Not only sex, but also kissing, cuddling, massaging, lying down and caressing my partner's body, having a chance to make my partner happy, just... anything ...

I am starting to look for ways to actively kill my sex drive, because I dont believe I will ever have a chance to have sex, unless I pay for it. I do not want to become an incel, someone who just thinks I deserve sex, because I know I do not deserve it. 

I am too scared to talk to my doctor, to look for options for chemical castraction or something else, dont even know whats legal and possible in my country (Denmark)."

I feel pointless, hopeless, alone, and afraid. I feel so tired, like I’m drained of energy. All I want to do is not think. I want to sleep. I randomly start crying when I think about how deep in this hole I am stuck, how never ending it feels. I watch shows that are supposed to make me happy and it makes me cry because I wish I had what they had (good friends, family, etc). 

I went on a 2 day vacation to try and perk up, but I still felt the same way. I floated in a pool for 6 hours and felt no happiness, just the same upsetting feelings that I felt before the vacation. Then I got home from that vacation with some Chick-fil-A fries, and as I was putting them on my plate I started crying thinking to myself “you have no purpose, no one cares about you” etc. this keeps happening, as mentioned, just random crying when doing things.

But the thing is, I am too afraid to die, so I don’t want to. Because of that, I don’t know if I’m actually depressed where I need meds, or if I’m just going through a sad spell. Because again, I don’t want to kill myself, I just feel like I’m drowning in these feelings, and I’d like to just sleep or stay in bed."

My girlfriend of 3 months has now revealed that she had near past suicide attemps and almost daily mental breakdowns. I knew she wasnt in a good mental condition but I didnt know it was this bad.

I have no clue what to do.. I tried giving her as much comfort, tried to distract her from her troublesome past with bad parenting from her father, a carcrash 3 years ago and more traumatising events.... yet I feel like she is drifting more away from me each second we are not together, when we are not talking or even just being silent on calls...

I dont know how I would react to her suicide if she did it, so I openly told her that... I told her that I want to be a bind for her till we are both dead by everything besides suicide...

I live in Germany (NRW) and she lives in France in the Alsace region...

We are both in financial problems with her living barely off of government money with her 4 head family and me in less of a existential struggle in a direct way but due to everything in economy lately, in fear of going from low middle class to poverty in one strike with my family. I want to visit her later this year, somewhere between Haloween and the holidays, not just because of financial trouble but to also learn at least some french so I dont have to talk in English all the time, especially since her family doesnt speak english.



I want to help her with her struggles but I am unsure if I am enough alone and if a visit would be enough... I dont know about therapy as well since she has bad experiences with it and I fear that she has some small traumas from it as well.... I dont know what to do...

I hate the thought of being the reason my parents fight or the reason my mom has no energy to do anything anymore. I hate lying but I hate facing the truth more, Idk what to do, I've been planning on ultimately ending things the past few days. I know that ""suicide is a permanent decision to a temporary problem"" but I don't even see when this pain will end, I cause so many problems at home that I know that they'll be better off without me. I want to wait until college but that's too far. my sisters have done the most for me and I keep burdening them.

I know they love me but I also know they're tired of me.

all my friends are amazing and I love my boyfriend more than anything. one of the very few reasons I don't want to go through with my suicidal thoughts is because of him, I know he'll be devastated and maybe even blame himself and I don't want to do that to him but after tomorrow I don't think I can handle it anymore. He's one of the only people who believed in me and I know I would be burdening him but I don't know, I don't know.

sorry if this was dramatic, I just don't know what to do."

It’s the same with all these mental health issues e.g. PTSD, OCD, Schizophrenia etc. 

It seems most people either come out of it organically or they remain in their depression. I’m tired for treatment after treatment being a disappointment, it’s been 20 years. I’ve taken part in the latest clinical studies for treatment resistant depression etc but no improvement. I’ve now become apathetic, I’m no longer seeking treatment as I have lost faith that the medical field actually is able to treat mental illness. From what I can see it’s a process of ‘poke here, prod there, eat this, try that, do some more of that, give it a kick to see if it turns on’… I think you get the idea, I’m tired of caring to only expose myself to further disappointment to the latest ‘new trending hype treatment’. 

I’m not blaming, of course not as I know there’s people working hard and wouldn’t want more than to find highly effective treatments that work for the majority but god damn this is infuriating."

I’ve moved to different cities/countries a few times in the past 8 years but always tried to keep in touch with my loved ones until I could see them again. No matter how hard I tried, they all left me, no one put enough effort in being my friend. They don’t text back, they don’t ask me how I am, how is my life, and if they do, they take like a month to reply.

I’ve been living in this new country for 1 year and a half now and don’t have any good friends, only colleagues, people who would invite me to go to parties and so on, but don’t engage in getting to know me better. Whenever I tried talking about myself - either in person or texting - they would just shut me off. So I lost interest in being with people and trying to open up myself for them. I feel no one really cares. I don’t feel supported by anyone - colleagues, family, people once I considered my “friends”. I am going through a lot, depression and anxiety, and I just don’t have anyone to REALLY talk to, go deep in the conversation, except by my therapist.

The ones I once trusted in have hurt me a LOT, so I don’t have them in my life anymore.

I just feel a void in my chest and wanna stay in my room 24/7.. and wonder whether there is a problem with me, so no one wants to stick around"

I drop down to a place where I feel so terrible that I just want to cry.  I feel immense guilt, fear and anxiety.  I reach out to people when this happens.  Unfortunately it happens more than I would like and more than what other people would like.  People have me pegged as depressed and perhaps a burden, an annoyance.  I don’t blame them.  I don’t always like it when people vent and bring my mood down so why should other people.  This realization leads to feelings of more inadequacy.  My therapist tells me that I need to recognize where it’s coming from, my dysfunctional childhood be easy on myself, and don’t beat myself up.  To recognize that all emotions are valid.  A way to block the noise. The problem is, when I’m in it, all I want to do is to hold on tight to someone.  To feel like I’m cared for.  To talk it out.

I had a lot of baggage from my ex-gf, but I met somebody who made me care about myself and them a lot more, making me a better person. I was rejected though, because she was aromantic & asexual, but I stayed good friends because we had a really good friendship already.

Last Friday, she visited me in my hometown and we spent the equivalent of every waking hour together doing things. 

It's wrong to try to pursue anything with her, and I know that. I put aside my romantic thoughts to be a good friend and somebody she'd enjoy hanging out with. And it was fine for a long time but every time it'd hurt just a bit less, and I thought that I would be okay.

Tonight, she got her flight times mixed up and I realized I won't be able to say goodbye. She's moving away this year and we will no longer be able to see each other on a daily basis.

Not being able to properly say goodbye was something my ex-gf did, and it hurt me and left me with the constant insecurity that I wasn't good enough or simply I've annoyed her. Something I'm afraid I've done to my current friend. 

This whole pandemic has been me trying to work on myself and something as simple as saying goodbye to somebody I care about deeply has absolutely torn me to shreds. 

She's given me a lot of joy and I'm afraid I won't be able to find the same happiness in the future.

To start we are your average family living in Ontario Canada, we used to consider ourselves middle class, however, in Canada it is like the middle class is disappearing as it becomes extremely hard to afford anything here. Both my parents are self employed. my mom works for a non-profit company, however is the only paid employee there, although she doesn't make much of anything.  My dad does contracting, he owns his own business, however it is a small business and he has no employees because his business doesn't make enough to cover all the overhead.

 Both my parents have worked their asses off all their lives to provide for me and my 2 sisters. I graduated college a few years ago and just graduated university in April. I have worked full time through grade 12, college and university at a retail store, to pay for my schooling. My parents always wanted to help, and they did, they paid for a portion of my schooling, but i know it is not something they can afford. We aren't broke, but i know my parents live paycheaque to paycheaque.

I just had a conversation with my mom regarding pensions and retirement, and she basically looked at me and said her and my dad could never retire because CPP (Canada Pension) will never be enough to help them pay off the house and all the bills. And she told me that she wants me and my sisters to learn from them and ensure that we get good jobs and save money when we can so that one day we don't end up like them. Both my parents grew up on budgets. my grandparents could not afford to buy things for my parents and their siblings all the time. They had to work extra hard for things. And this is why my parents have worked so hard so that me and my sisters could have things we wanted

My dream in life, or in the next few years anyways, is to be able to get a great job, and give back to my parents, pay off their house and any debt they have. give them a nice trip somewhere so that they can have some time to enjoy themselves.  I feel bad for my mom especially. both her parents have passed away, and they were quite young too. My grandfather passed when he was 67 and my grandmother just passed away almost 2 years ago at the age of 76. My grandma never saw retirement. She fully retired on boxing day of 2019, and ended up in the hospital a few months later and never came out. I don't want my parents to have to work till the day they die. It is really hard to watch such hard working and caring people, struggle with just the basic necessities of life.

Hello everyone,
Hope this post finds you well mentally and physically! 
I was wondering if you could share your opinion regarding my concern lately.
So , my concern is that lately maybe not that lately ( it just happened so slowly that I did not see it coming so I have even lost the concept of time ) I have started to enjoy spending time alone .I am a very social person ( or should I say  I was) that used to love spending time with people I love and care about . I was truly and genuinely happy when my best friends would call me to hang out .But now not only I do not take the first step to invite other people ,I also try to find reasons( even LIES )to not go out when others invite me . I would rather do the activities alone and I enjoy doing them alone to the degree it is starting to concern me .I would like to go watch a movie in cinema ALONE ( planning to go for it tomorrow),go shopping, eating in restaurants, going to the gym ALONE .And what intrigues me is the fact that nothing has happened to my life to cause such big change in my personality. I have a good life ( thanks God) and i still love people and friend around me and care about them .If I do not like to spend time alone I like to meet new people and learn about them .

Is this sign of depression?

I feel bad about writing this because I know it's a first world problem but I really need to vent because my relatives and friends don't take me seriously, they always think I'm joking or even worse, look at me in a pitiful way like they assume it's impossible for me to leave this country. I currently live in an european southern country, the place I was born, the one where people talk using hands. I have a Bachelor degree in Psychology, I'm getting a Master's degree at the moment and I'm planning on getting even more advanced academic titles. I've always felt displaced and dreamed about leaving since I can remember, I recall starting seriously daydreaming about leaving when I was 13, I wanted to live in Florida, then California, then again I thought about moving to Canada, the last place I wanted to move to was Washington State. Now I just feel desperate to reach any place in the US, I'd even consider moving to the sh-ttiest State just to get as far away as I can from here. I generally don't enjoy living life staying in the same spot for a long time, it frustrates me so much that it brings me to the point of refusing social interactions, I'm giving up hanging out, doing normal things that people generally find amusing or relaxing. I found out I was not made to stay in the same place forever when I moved to Germany for two years, and then came back home desperate to leave again. I can't escape this dreadful feeling of being trapped wherever I go, and also I can't really say I appreciate my own people's mentality and general interests. Some of the people I know personally have been just once or twice to a foreign country in the EU and even fewer have seen what's outside of Europe, so they don't really understand my point of view, they all think they're having it good living life in this sh*thole of a country and giving up on experiencing things elsewhere because they can't think of a more perfect place to live in than their own. I mean, it's really taking a toll on my mental state and general wellbeing, this train of thoughts is constantly circling in my head giving me anxiety and depression. Am I just going mad or do I really need a change? Is it worth it to keep hoping to escape from here? P.s. Sorry for any mistake, as you can guess english is not my native language."

Mostly a vent, but looking for advice too.  


I don't even know where to begin so this is gonna be a bit jumbled.

 I'm currently 19 years old (F) and in college. Frankly, I cannot find a single thing in life that I look forward to or am happy about. 

My family life is complete shit. My dad, a raging alcoholic hasn't made an effort to talk to me since I was 12, and every time I speak to my mom I end up feeling horrible. My mom doesn't support me with anything, making fun of me constantly for how I act, how I dress, my friends, my dating life, and anything else you can think of. I can't remember the last time she complimented me, and just too sum up the kind of person she is, she didn't come to my high school graduation because she didn't care. I've told her many many many times about how much she hurts my feelings, and she turns it around and says how if I was a better kid, she wouldn't get so mad. My step dad has crazy anger issues, and living in a home where I'm constantly walking on egg shells, I have pretty bad anxiety. I obviously cannot get a new family and the idea of living the rest of my life with these people as my family sounds like living hell.

I have a group of friends both from home and college, and as bad as it sounds, I don't even think I like them. For some reason, in every friend group I have ever been in, I am always the end of the joke. I bring this up many many times about how it hurts my feelings, yet nothing ever is done, and it constantly happens. I have obviously come to the conclusion that I must be the issue, but I'm not sure what I do that makes me so easy to make fun of. I am currently home for the summer, and being with my friends no longer brings me joy, and I feel no benefit in seeing them anymore. I do not look forward to going back to school, because it's just going to be the same thing, except I have to live with these people.   


I try so so so hard to be a nice and likable person, and I don't understand how I am so so sad and treated like this, yet people who are so evil and mean get to be so happy, and well treated by others. I never show anger towards others, even when I am. I will share anything, and I never asked for money or anything in return. I will drop anything if my friends need comfort, and I am extremely loyal. I will never ever say no, even if I do not want to do something, and I always always put others in front of myself. My friends have even pointed out how I am one of the nicest people they know, and so I don't understand why I am treated like a fucking joke. Now, I am very self aware of my issues. I am super annoying, I love to talk, I talk loud, laugh loud, and I realize that when I'm in a room, I am taking up space for someone else who would be much more enjoyable to be around. I think my friends pity me, which is why they put up with me. Living life knowing this is awful, and I don't see a point in trying to make new friends, as the exact thing will happen over and over. I just want to feel as though I'm wanted, which I know isn't the case, but it'd feel nice once and awhile.  


I absolutely hate myself. For starters, I hate how I look. I am overweight, not extremely, but at least 50 pounds, and if I'm being honest, I don't see a point in losing the weight. I will just be left with loose skin and sagging parts, even though I'm only 19. So either way, my body will not be attractive. I also think frankly I am just ugly in the face, which is hard to deal with as there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I hate my personality, as I stated before I am super annoying, which is apparently one of the worst things to be. Everyone in life tells me all the time about how I talk too much or am too loud, and even though I try, I don't know how to stop.  I know it's easy to say ""don't care what others think about you"" but honestly that is the only thing I care about. In reality, what is life without love and people to share it with. I think thats why I put up with everything, because having shitty friends is better than no friends right?  


Like I mentioned, I'm in college, which is the biggest stressor of my life. It's so ungodly expensive, and I can't deal with the fact that I'm doing something I fucking hate to just be in debt for the rest of my life, working a job I'm going to hate. The thing is, I don't know what else to do. I cannot think of a single thing I want to do with my life. I absolutely hate my summer job, and I dread waking up every morning. I'm not even making enough to be able to afford school, and I have no clue what I'm going to do next year when the tuition bill hits.  


Every morning when I wake up, I am filled with and overwhelming amount of anger and sadness, because frankly I do not want to be alive anymore. There is absolutely nothing I look forward to, and the idea of living this life for 60-70 more years makes me want to blow my fucking brains out. However, for some fucking reason, I still have the hope that things are going to get better. Killing myself will just eliminate all chances of me ever finding happiness, but is living life like this worth waiting for that? 

I cannot remember the last time I felt at peace or happy, and I don't know how other people are okay living like this. Maybe they aren't and I'm just being a baby, and this is how life really is. Whatever it is, this shit is fucking pointless. I'm doomed for a lifetime of hell, just to die. If this is really the point of life, then what. the. fuck. I have no hobbies, nothing interests me, I don't like music anymore, I don't like movies or tv. I don't like hanging out with my friends or my family. All I do is force myself to get through the day so I can go home, and lay in my bed and mindlessly scroll through tiktok. 

If you managed to read through this whole thing of me just complaining about my life, thank you, and if anyone has any advice on what I should do, let me know because I'm lost."

This will be the longest message I've ever sent you. I have so much on my mind and heart now, so I'm going to let it flow. 

It's been really bad. For the past few days I've been feeling really suicidal. I'm sorry if this is too much but I have no one else to tell it to. I feel like I've exhausted all the resources I could imagine to help myself. Even speed doesn't work anymore because I've used it too much and got accustomed.

If there is a hope, it's really hard to see it now. I'm considering going back to the hospital. I can't say the treatment there is very professional, but at least I won't be alone. And I've never really been hospitalized for depression, only anxiety.

I received the script for the movie I was supposed to be in next month but haven't even opened the message because I feel so mentally disabled I can't find the energy for it and dunno if I'll be available after all.

Speaking of the hospital, the psychologist I saw there from time to time was this super soft spoken lady who would try to be like an unconditionally loving mother and support you in any way. But it felt a bit artificial for me and shallow, I didn't feel I could go in the depths with her.

Sorry for the rant, I just want to talk to you and I dunno when I will stop. It feels a little therapeutic.

Tomorrow there's a meditation workshop for free that an old acquaintance of mine is organising. Maybe it's a sign and I should go there to have a talk with him. I don't hope for miracles though. But just a little bit of hope would be nice. I feel I need a father, a spiritual guide, a therapist and psychiatrist in one person. Christians say that's God (ok, maybe not the psychiatrist bit). 

And oh how happy I'd be if that was true. If all my prayers didn't hit the brick wall of uncaring and incomprehensible cosmos. Scratch all the fairly sensible arguments for God from many disciplines - it all means nothing if that god cannot help me to not kill myself. And I don't even know exactly what kind of help I need. Most of the things in my life are broken - relationships, career and, most importantly, mental health.

I am afraid of suicide. But sometimes the thought of it gives me a temporary feeling of relief - I can leave when I can't take anymore, and whatever comes next is hopefully better than this.

I realised that I will probably post this message on the depression subreddit. So I'll do a quick recap of how I got here (most of which you know).

I've been having mental health issues for years now on/off, and the latest episode began more than 2 years ago. First as remission of existential anxiety and obsessive thoughts. They were so disturbing that I hospitalized myself. The time in the hospital helped somewhat, but the results didn't last as mutch as I'd liked them to.

Then slowly I started censoring my own thoughts, not following down the rabbit hole of wanting to grasp cosmic mysteries and incomprehensibilies. Sheer force of will, just forbade myself these thoughts. That was a relief, but along with this I developed depression. No desire or interest in activities, apart from numbing myself. My super active extroverted personality almost totally gone. Everything feels too hard and I just want to be left alone.

Where I rot in deep loneliness. I've tried to rekindle relationships with people who I considered my friends but nothing came of it. I don't think I did anything wrong, I was approaching them on a positive note, but maybe my depressed vibes speak louder than my words and people don't feel ready to face and support such darkness.

I really don't think there's anything much wrong with suicide anyway. Sure, the trauma for family is my main concern. My mother loves me even though she's clueless as how to help me.

If I go to a different dimension after death, let's hope it's a bit better than this broken brain. If oblivion awaits me after death, it's tragic, but what can I do. I won't care or suffer anymore so there.

While I was tripping on ketamine last night I had an intense spiritual connection experience, and in it I prayed so hard for help, and there was a feeling the connection is somewhat real. But in the end, of course, nothing came of it. I came down and was alone and stuck.

I must clarify that I am not a long-term drug user. I only picked them up when my depression was too hard to bear and nothing seemed to help - I was desperate for temporary relief at any cost. 

I've tried 3 different antidepressants for 2 months each, and they were nothing more than a sugar pill. I tried exercise, being in nature, traveling, talk therapy (although never felt the therapist is right for me, so there still might be a chance). 

I think I'm gonna call the emergency hotline tomorrow and see what they would suggest in my situation. I'd like to put suicide as the very last option. 

So, thank you for reading this. It became twice as long because mid-writing I decided I'll post it on Reddit. 

Thanks again for being there."

Last year I found a way of making my friends in highschool hate me so they wouldn't miss me and I poisoned myself in the holydays. 
I told my friends from my other former school because I wanted them to know what I was doing.
One particular friend called Justin called me and even though he was sobbing tried to talk me out of it in every way he could. Some time later my sister found me and an ambulance which had already been called came to scoop me up. I spent 2 days in hospital of which I couldn't sleep even an hour.
The second morning a male nurse came in to give me washing utensils and asked me if I'd rather have half an hour more of rest to which I replied with yes. Immediately after he'd left the room a female nurse in the hall said:""He's been lying there all day and now he wants more sleep?"" And used a german saying which rougly translates to ""that's where the friendship ends"".
When I heard that I wanted to choke myself.

After that they immediately transported me to a clinic for the mentally ill. I had told a very good friend of mine 5 years ago that this was my biggest phobia. The first day was the worst since I was stationed in a closed facility where I would sleep behind barred windows. I called my dad and he tried to calm me down but I was violently crying and felt left behind so I just hung up. I slept the whole rest of the day eating nothing so I was up all night. I didn't know what to do so I got my phone out and read through all of Ichi the Killer until morning.

On day 2 I had calmed down a bit and formed a plan. I was blood tested on that day and due to my sleep deprivity and fasting the former day I got really nauseous. Since I knew they weren't just gonna let me go I played nice. I was moved to a half open station the next day after an evaluation and the promise that I wasn't going to hurt myself.

In the following five days I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and prescribed with antidepressants. I'm also lucky that my best friends parents work for the clinic so they're renting a house on the facility grounds which meant that he could visit me often.

Since I was still in school I was asked to inform my teachers of my current situation and maybe figure out a way to get homework sent so they could still grade me.
On day five I was offered to be let go the next weekend so I could reattend school which was just a narrative I had followed because I didn't care about it at all.

When I came home my parents didn't want me to go to school for a while at least. After a few months, in which I still took prescribed antidepressants, I had some violent outbursts after I felt that my father was making fun of me. He then followed me to my room but failed to calm me down again. I'm a brutal person but I didn't want to hurt my dad because he's the most important person in my life so I punched a cabinet so hard that the door cracked.
I got a new prescription for anger management.

Some weeks later when my parents finally wanted me to go to school again I told them I would drop out and get a job of which my dad was positively surprised. But that was just something I said to have more time home doing nothing.

My dad wanted me to get therapy for my BPD and after a session where I was offered therapy on station like before or therapy that was like a school day after which I could go home again.
I declined both because I didn't want to be anywhere other than home anymore.

Then came the day that I did drop out of school and went to the ""Arbeitsamt"", which is basically a job center on crack, and told them I was searching for work. I missed the first meeting they sent me and am now waiting for a second after some paperwork. Also I should mention that I'm not insured right now.

My dad set me a deadline to get work until August after which he would throw me out of the house which I don't think he would do but you never know. 

Now we are in the present and I have nothing left to live. I don't have goals or ambitions and I don't want to get a job and work. What would be the reason to bust my ass all day getting paid an atom of what politicians make being idiots. I don't want money because there's nothing in this world worth buying. I don't need a car, a house or anything fancy. I don't want to settle down or have a family of my own and I don't care if people remember me as a hero, an asshole, or not at all. I don't want to see the world or help humanity. And living just so my friends and family don't have to see me die is painful and has gotten old after 8th grade.

There is just no reason for me to live anymore and I'm going to wait till next weekend so I can talk with my best friend for a last time and this time I'm going to make sure as shit that no ambulance can arrive in time. I'm going to cut my wrists or my carotid artery maybe even both. I seriously don't think anyone can help me anymore so I think this is more of a goodbye for good post.

Hope you guys will be off better than I am."

I’ve been with the love of my life for 4 years, and we have no major problems between us. Good sex life we get along and everything. 

This year has been slowly chipping away at my sanity though. My childhood dog passed away back in early December. She was 14 years old. I’m 25 for reference. She was truly my best friend. Soon after that, I went no contact with my mother. We have had our issues over the past decade but the seeds of this had been planted long before I was born. That’s actually a positive thing I do feel much better without her around as twisted as it may seem. But the event that caused it hurt and made me angry. 

I’ve been working evening and night shifts for over a year. They were fine at first but since the spring my friend group has expanded without me. Now my friends are a part of a larger group who gets together for all kinds of fun stuff. My gf gets to hang out and be a part of it but I am stuck at work or sleeping for the next shift. I can really only come out Thursday nights after 11pm so even then I miss out on like half the night. 

To make things worse, my year was just beginning to get better as I got closer to one of our best friends, when I ruined it a week later. And never got the chance to talk it out and get closure because they went away that week and moved on from the whole thing without me. So I’m a little hung up on that. 

Finally, I’m desperate to get out of my job for something with better hours and pay. But I’m booked for a (paid) vacation in September and starting a new job will mess that up. And I’ve been receiving opportunities that I’ve passed on due to this. If something comes along that is really worth it though I’ll go for it.

My mother had some issues while I was growing up, I was always scared of her rather than enjoyed her presence. I could take some blueberries out of the fridge as a 5 year old and she would completely blow up and heavily hurt me with her words. I would never see her socialize with other parents or invite anyone over. Even when she did manage to find someone, the relationship was short lived. 

I was never allowed to leave the house when I was a kid, I had school and that was it. I was raised on the tv. Every time I asked to join a club, she would laugh and call it a waste of time. If I had friend conflict, I would cry and ask her for her guidance. She told me to cut them off, they’re not good enough for us. She would heavily criticize all of their flaws, from elementary school and middle school - I felt that I couldn’t be with anyone unless they were absolutely perfect. On top of that, I feel that my isolated childhood did not teach me the boundaries within a conversation, and I felt that I’ve hurt a lot of people in my life unknowingly. I didn’t learn to apologize til I was in 7th grade. 

My relationships became more and more short lived.This went on for years, and I became an extrovert that slowly turned found comfort in being an introvert. I have been kicked out of 4 friend groups, all ended up very messy and traumatizing. I tried informing my dorm mates prior that I had social awkwardness or difficulty but that did not prevent them from giving me hell for it. 

I recently found out she cut me off from all of my dads extended family (including my dad) AND her family for the tiniest reason. She claimed that they do not love me and they are all heavily flawed. I thought they were abusive. They tried reaching out for years, but whenever they would pop up on my social media and I would ask about them, she would delete them.

I’m completely traumatized. I cannot leave my room, I’m afraid to be hurt again, or hurt the people I’ve grown so attached to to. I find it hard to get up and do anything, I can’t solely blame my mom because it was me who carried out all the bad endings in my life. I find relationships dating back to middle school replaying in my head over and over again. If I think about them too much, I get verbal ticks - maybe my brain trying to snap me out of thought. I feel so much guilt, and I feel like I’m sick in an endless loop. Any suggestion? Anyone who can relate…?"

I have been alternating between feeling depressed and anxious for these past few days. Today has been one of the worst days in a while. 
To top it all off, it’s just one of those annoying days.  Let’s see, First the ladies I’ve been helping out for the past little while is ignoring me now that she’s back with a girlfriend.  Next I did something foolish in a volunteer online community I help run. 
The owner is  upset with me, it’s making me nervous for when he gets out of work, because he has a temper and there’s a slight chance I might get removed. 

The people who I want to talk to aren’t around.  Let’s see what else…. Theres a lady who I talk to sometimes  who zaps my energy. She’s a bit of an attention seeker and clingy to say the least. I don’t have the energy to deal with her right now, she sent me 7 messages with in the last few hours. 
Do you think she’ll get the hint I’m not in the mood for talking? Well apparently not. I’m putting off talking with her until at least tomorrow morning.  Last time I told her I wasn’t in the mood for talking she Still sent a bunch of random emoji’s. There  will probably be at least 10 to 15 messages of hers waiting for me tomorrow. But I don’t really care. 
Oh and I can’t even watch my comfort show on HBO max because the app is being stupid. I just want today to be over."

3569,I feel miserable,w29xfw,prettybroken625,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w29xfw/i_feel_miserable/,2,depression,False,"“Why are you still here?” is what my dad told me when I was at the bathroom, 2 minutes after I entered, when I clearly told him I want to go there.

Yesterday I went to my boyfriends house and I ate with his family. I wanted to eat something else other than them, and his parents were okay with it, but all through dinner I expected one of them to scream at me and scold me “Why can’t you eat the same thing as us? Why do you always have to eat something else?” 

This is what my dad did to me. I am jealous, depressed, empty, a people pleaser, I have no trust in myself or my abilities. My dad never gave me attention, he only loved toddlers and would shower them with gifts and attention, kisses, everything, while I was getting scolded for everything I did. Whenever he calls my name, I instantly know I did something and will get scolded, or I will be given orders. My name is a trauma in itself, as I get shivers down my spine when my boyfriend calls me by my name, I know when a man calls my name I have screwed up something. 

Some family friends from Spain came home these days, and they have a toddler, and obviously my dad showers her with attention, while I have to sit and watch. I can’t help but feel jealous over her; she did nothing to gain it, she is just cute and small, while I did everything I could to get it, and I’m not worthy of it. How can I feel when someone gets what I wanted the most in my life just because they are small and cute? While I worked my butt off to get it, and all i got instead was screams, scolding, beating threats.

I hide everything because I’m afraid of judgement. I’m jealous over anyone that gets more attention than me because I never received it as a child, I always had to fight over it. I hate myself because all my life I was taught to hate myself. I can never cry because that’s a sign of weakness and people can use it against me. I’m constantly angry and aggressive because I was taught to be like this; I push people away because I’m afraid they will leave me in the end.

I can never change the tv channel because I’ll get screamed at; I always get judged by what I eat so that’s why I eat alone, and when they asked me what I ate it’s better to lie than tell the truth so I can avoid the screaming. I will actively lie if it means I can avoid scolding and screaming. I know my dad’s full work schedule so I can calculate if I have time to eat and do house chores so I wouldn’t get scolded. I’m afraid of showing people music because I’m afraid of judgement, and whenever someone asks me “come on, put some music” i instantly change the subject, i also think i really have a bad taste in music but that’s just my opinion.

All my life I was told “you’re not good enough, you can’t do anything right, when will you leave already?, you’re so annoying” when I told them I am depressed they laughed about it and still remind me of it from time to time; my dad makes jokes while my mom denies I have a problem. 

I can’t help but hate myself. I’m in a bad place, I was always in a bad place, I can’t see a way out no matter how much i try. I want to cry all day and hopefully it will fade away with time. I feel empty and alone, like I have no one to talk to.

I wanted to take it off my chest by posting here, ‘talking’ to someone as there are a lot of things going on. I have so much more to share so I can finally take it all off, but this is all I can manage. I’m sorry it has no proper begnning or ending, I can’t even do that so add to the list of “why i’m not good enough” haha."
3570,What's the Point Anymore?,w29ry4,TheRoseStone,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w29ry4/whats_the_point_anymore/,2,depression,False,"I've just finished college and I've lost all my friends. Basically, one of them pretty much turned against me, and spent most of the year being hyper aggressive towards me, and just treating me like shit. It also appears that, despite the fact two of them were in agreement with me over her being in the wrong, they've all taken her side, and I can't remember the last time any of them made the effort to reach out.

On top of that, my grades this semester took a massive flop, and my 1.1 degree dropped to a 2.1. This also means I'll have to reconsider a lot of masters options. Having gone all through school without any friends,  I've ended up basing my entire self-worth/ self-esteem on my academic skills. Needless to say, these grades were soul crushing, and I've been c*tting myself regularly since.

I'll be moving to a new city for work soon, but if there's anything Reddits taught me (at least on the subreddits I've seen), making friends post college is near impossible. Add in my social ineptitude, and I genuinely think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. I just want it all to be over.."

My family. We aren't as close as other families. To be precise, I was raised in a family where abuse and toxicity is normalized. My father is always abusing my Mother. When I was younger my Dad often hit and beat my mom although he's not hurting my mom physically anymore he still gives her a hard time today. I have two sisters (I'm a guy btw) which I can't relate to especially when I need someone in my family to talk about ""guy"" stuff. 

My father only thinks about my future to the point of being a control freak to ensure that I will have a good life (which is not a bad thing ik) but I feel restrained by his decisions you know why? I can't even style my own hair without him constantly saying things that having a long hair makes me look untidy. I didn't even have a choice in my college course (I'm an engineering student btw) mind you that I love drawing although I'm not good yet. Now I can confidently say that my studies killed my passion for drawing. I feel so unmotivated so lost and so 'empty'. The other thing that I've been dealing with is hair loss. Man, I fucking hate this confidence killing situation and guess what my parents also gaslight my hair loss situation. They say I'm thinking too much that I don't sleep early that's why I'm losing my hair. They are so hard to get through and to ask for help that I always ended up feeling trapped in my situation.

I don't have much left in the tank. I grow weary of my situations everyday. I've been leaving signs for people to help me and as I said earlier I got hit by the reality of being alone and not belonging to any other circle of friends. I am an unattractive guy with failed friendships and relationships at the age of 20. Most of my days were spent in my room as I drown with these thoughts. Man, I feel trapped I recently turned 20 and all I wished were for someone to hug me on my birthday. You know if you think that some of your friends are tired a hug or even a tap to their shoulder is enough to assure them they're not alone. 

I wrote this because I wanted help. I'm asking you guys how do I get out? How can I be free from this sadness? I really want to know because I wanna feel alive again. I don't wanna kill myself I want to see myself get out of this shithole. Help me.

Okay so I'm spiraling. Trying to convince myself to figure out something to do but having no energy to do anything. Now I'm thinking about everything that I hate about my life yadda yadda. Well if I can't find something recreational to do, how about I try to get a head start on some of my responsibilities? Why don't you look for a job? Open your email, gives you anxiety. Okay let's try Indeed. Nope, just makes you feel self conscious. Too many tears in your eyes, you can barely read the screen. 

You haven't thought about hurting yourself in ages. Oh surprise suddenly you're filled with enough hatred to want to rip your jaw from your skull. If you had the balls to cut your leg off you'd have done it by now. Self control and what little sanity left is the only thing preventing you.

I wanted to talk to friends, well aware that I'd just get ignored because nobody there *actually* likes me. They all just tolerate me. But they're the only group I have so I have to just fucking deal with it. I decided against speaking to anyone. Turns out one of my friends got a job today. Now everyone's gotten a job OF COURSE I can't get one, though. Feeling even worse.

After all this I was like, okay. Either I'm about to perform a self harm of the century after how I'm feeling or I'll get high as balls and frankly pray it's an overdose but knowing that I'm not taking nearly enough of a dose to die.

Now my dog is fucking coughing for who knows fucking why and I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH IT. I don't know if she's hurt or what but it's just too much I can't. I want to help but I am not in a mentally well place to deal with someone else in distress cause I'm just absorbing all their distress even more. I can hear her coughing through the door. My mom keeps calling me out to clean up the throw up. If I get called out one more time I will explode. The sound of the coughing alone is horrible for me right now. Someone else needs to deal with this, I'm sorry.

Every time I have reached out it has fallen on deaf ears. Much of what life I had is gone now. I have accepted the worst possible scenario, but I feel I am working in vain to try and prevent it anyways. I want help, but at this point I don't know what will.

I live alone. I have been for years now. I have no friends that wish to see me, when I go to see my family once a month I feel nothing. I have struggled to find a job since Feb/March. My friends online hold me up, usually... 

I have reached out to institutions to assist with finding a job, help pay bills, food, clothing... But I'm not able to take advantage of those privileges or resources. 

When I am not 'plugged in' to the online world my mind slumps into this constant haze of inadequacy. I sent out 70 applications to jobs in the last month alone, I have rewritten my resume what feels like a few hundred times now. I have not gotten a single call back... That plays on my mind too. Am I just unemployable? Insufferable? I feel like my own friends online could take me or leave me honestly. Romance is impossible for me. Who would want a guy who isn't working, who's friends are non existent, has lived alone for years, only leaves the apartment to run and to get groceries.

It's been that way ever since I was abducted earlier this year by people I considered friends. Getting over that has been its own challenge... On top of everything else I kind of feel numb now. Like I can't connect with anybody or my emotions and care will be taken advantage of. 

The only respite, the only thing keeping my mind from falling apart completely, is that I started dreaming back in April. For the first time in years. I will sleep and the places in my dreams have compassion, warmth, they make my mind solve problems, the most urgency I experience in them is that of a leisurely day trip to where a road takes you. And then I will wake back up into hell. Drag myself out of bed, force a shower, and just relive the cycle of thoughts and job applications hoping something sticks. Hoping that someone might notice the effort and reward it. Most days it's all I can do to get a glass of water. Most days I forget to eat because I have no appetite. Most days I want it to be over. I look forward to sleeping more than anything, and it doesn't matter how long my body chooses to extend its insomniatic tendencies because I know exhaustion will take over eventually and I can finally feel again, even if it's just for four hours. 

I have a therapist. They try to keep me on track. I have medical insurance, and doctors tell me I am perfectly fine. My savings are gone but they have managed to keep this roof over my head, and maybe I can make it to the end of my lease. But then.... I don't know what I will do. No place to stay and no job to secure one. I don't know where I will go or what happens to me then. That might be the end of it for me. But then again I always seem to have more space to fall through. Maybe there is something lower than rock bottom and I'll be the first to find out. Maybe. 

I haven't made an attempt in almost ten years, and I have certainly had many lows between then and now. However I have never been able to stop the thoughts. 

Medication has not helped. They either messed with my body or made my mental state worse or in some cases both. And I have tried several at this point. 



If you made it this far I appreciate it. I hope anyone that took the time to read any of this can find their way out of whatever brought them to this reddit page. Nobody deserves to go through this. Don't worry about the magnitude of what has affected you. We all have a different threshold. We can all only deal with so much. We are human.

 It is often said that it's easier to confide ourselves to the strangers, so here i am.

 For many reasons, I feel frustrated almost daily. I feel like I'm screwing up in pretty everything. My mental state has also taken big hits lately. After seeing a specialist, it seems that I have an anxiety-depressive disorder. There are positive stuff, but the negatives are clearly the most present and hits very hard. 

 My mains problems last over time , some of them from more than a decade (loneliness in friendship and love, tendency to lower myself, unsatisfaction in general in my projects, dealing with anger and frustration...). It's like it's going in circles. 

However, I really want to get back on track, to focus on the things that still make me vibrate,  be a better person and retreive this sensation of accomplishment that i kind of lost. 

Any tips for reducing this negativity, or be more serene ?"

Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option for me right now. I've had therapy in the past, but CBT didn't really work all that well for me because my overthinking brain likes to undermine any rational retort I provide to its anxious thoughts. 

Anyway, the point. I am tired of dealing with this crap. It seems like the only obstacle between me and a ""good"" life is my poor mental health. Since SSRIs don't work and therapy is not an option, what steps can I take to get better? I've thought of exercise as an option, but I'd just like to know if anyone who has gotten better can share something helped them.

Thanks!"
3586,A Complete Waste...,w28az1,dusteepoot,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w28az1/a_complete_waste/,2,depression,False,"Hello everyone. Been here a few times through the years to read, but now it's my turn. This is going to be a long one, so strap in.

I'm 36 yrs old, about to be divorced for the 3rd time. I have 2 kids, both live with their mothers (respectively). I was in the Air Force for 16 years. I did 2 tours in Iraq and in Afghanistan. I was recently administratively separated, due to misconduct. I failed a drug test for THC.

I've come to learn over time that ever since I was a small child, I hated growing attachment to people. Whether it was my family (parents, siblings) or my friends, I always put on a face and never tell how I truly felt. My parents divorced when I was an infant, but due to financial constraints my mother never moved out of my dad's house. Then, when I was 11 my mother just moved out and had to stop and explain that they'd been divorced for most of my life. I felt betrayed, to the point that I shut them off for the rest of my life. Everything we discuss is surface value, and I never call them. My mom has made some strides to reconnect with me, and stay connected at least for the sake of my children.

My siblings were always nice to me, and my brothers took it upon themselves to spend some time with me when I was younger. However, my eldest brother died when I was 17, and my other siblings all moved out. I guess I should mention that all of them are half-siblings. I am technically the only child with my parents.

Both parents were recovering from previous divorces, had 2 kids of their own, and met each other. Which is when I accidentally appeared. And yes my parents told me I was an accident. Years later, my mother would extrapolate even more by notifying me that my dad isn't even my biological father. Great to hear years later, mom. Thanks for that.

My first wife felt like it was fate. I believed strongly that we were meant to be together. Fast forward 3 years, we have a son together, and I caught her cheating with multiple people. It devastated me, to learn my wife did those things and didn't bother to tell me she left me. The divorce sucked, I lost alot of money and also custody of my son. His mother isn't exactly nice either when it comes to seeing him for visitation or spending the summer with me. She's been a pain in my ass ever since we split.

Wife #2 seemed like the polar opposite of my 1st wife. Everything was working great, until about 3 years later I realized that she was a leech who would never work or do anything responsible to help further the family's future. So I divorced her, and she got custody of my 2nd son. She's at least alot easier to deal with than the first. However, my son was diagnosed with Autism so I'll never be able to give him the attention he deserves. Oh yea, he was an accident just like me.

Now with wife #3, she's been the best I could've imagined. She holds qualities that the first 2 wives couldn't compare. But here we are, 5 years later and she said she's had enough of my terrible attitude, and the fact that I try to stay high 24/7. In my logic, I don't see anything wrong with what I was doing, but apparently I'm an embarrasment. She finally blamed all of our troubles on me, stating that getting kicked out of the air force is why we're having so many problems.

Now, this may seem like I'm looking for marital advice, or how I should try to reconnect with my estranged family or children. I don't want any of that. I want someone to explain to me why I should continue to give a shit about any of these people. Even my kids are getting along fine, without me. Why should I care anymore? Why should I care about anything? What is left for me to do? I raised a family multiple times, and failed. I have nobody to share my thoughts, feelings, or values with and I honestly don't care either. You guys are my last stop, before I work until I am debt free. Once I don't owe anyone money or anything, I'll gladly leave this stupid fucking planet behind.

Thanks for your time"
3587,My friends are toxic but I dont want to leave them.,w24x21,Mayolo2925,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w24x21/my_friends_are_toxic_but_i_dont_want_to_leave_them/,3,depression,False," 

Lets start off by saying that I have 2 major best friends from more than a year ago. The first one Miachel and the second Maria.

Something important before I start is that I've had a massive crush on Maria since 8 years.

Two week ago Miachel tells me that a friend of mine told MJ everything about my crush on her. Because of that I cut relationships with my other friend and I was pretty sad knowing that she knew.

Anyways one day Miachel tells me that we made a mistake and that he is really sorry. As you imagined he was the one who told her everything. I was really pissed of because I trusted him and he was using excuses like ""I was tiered at 2 am and I didnt know what I was doing"" I tried to tell him how disapointed I was but he told me ""I know you hate me but if you tell it to me I will kill myself""(i need to say that he didnt tell me like that but its cloe enough) he has told me abut killing himself and i have helped him but this had gone too far. I tried convincing him that I have forgiven him but Ive trully havent.

Now everything has gone back to normal, we talk daily and were back to being friends but yesterday we where all three on a call and I tryied telling them about my self-steem issues but they just brushed it off and said ""me too"" and when I try bringing up my mental problems (depresion and anorexy) they kkep ignoring me. And thats when I noticed that they have veen doing this all the time we have veen friends. Idk why but I called one of my other best friends but I forgot that he was Maria's ex so he joins quite pissed off because he is in an other country and I didnt knew he leaves making me feel worse and then Miachel tells me that I made a mistake and that now Maria is really mad at me.

I was as confused as maybe you are rn but then he explains that he told him random things to my friend (the one I just called) that Maria dared him to but then my friend asks is they are on call and idk why he says no and now he noticed even though that he told him no 3 h before I called my friend.

So they are mad because they lied to him and then tried making me feel guilty by saing ""ohh, thaks now an other relationship is over"" or mumbling things like that and in retrospective thats a MAJOR red flag but anyways when I heard those lower voice things I just hang of the call. it has veen 2 days and noone has asked me about that.

So I dont want to leave them but I think they are really bad friend and they are affecting my whole life, what should I do?"
3588,I don't feel like anything I do matters,w22n6s,SeaViper0136,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w22n6s/i_dont_feel_like_anything_i_do_matters/,5,depression,False,"I'm an 18 year old guy and I have really been feeling like crap. So my life has been very uneventful so far due to my parents not caring to get me into anything as a kid so my social skills are very underdeveloped. This has caused me to have no friends and lose all the ones I had. I also have trust issues due to the fact that the only people that were close to me took advantage of me not caring what happened to me as a result of their actions. This incudes sexually assaulting me, physically abusing me and just making feel worthless. 

A thing that has really made me depressed is the fact that I can't do anything anymore without fearing a bad outcome from it due to the fact that I have severe anxiety. This anxiety was mostly cause from my elementary school and my family due to the fact that I had very traumatizing events happen to me in my 18 years of living. The main one that has really scared me was the multiple occasions my father had really bad outbursts at my mother walking out of our house saying either ""You'll never see me again"" and ""I want to blow my brains out because of you!"". Something you may wonder is why are my parents together if they argue so much. Well that is because they didn't have to make us have to deal with a divorce and they didn't want us to deal with living in 2 homes.    Another traumatizing event that happened to me is when my neighbor that owned a large forest was working in it and a tree fell on him while he was working with his tractor crushing him underneath it. His sister and her husband lived a couple houses down and they noticed that he didn't come back home in the evening and the husband went looking for him and found his brother in law crushed under a tree and they called to police and he was sent away and later pronounced dead in the hospital. The thing the was so disturbing to me was when the husband told his wife, the sister of the dead farmer that her brother was killed. She freaked out having a panic attack and while she was in this panic attack she came to our house and knocked on the door and when my parents opened it she was screaming ""Bruce is dead!!!"" over and over again while crying and I had to listen to it as I was close to the door she was at.             I also had very embarrassing moments in elementary school that destroyed my confidence in doing things. 

Right now I do the same thing every single day and nothing changes. Nothing has changed since I was 13 asides the time I graduated from high school but all that did was change my daily schedule slightly. I have no friends to talk to an I feel like I have wasted my life. The only women I have ever loved that I am still trying to be with doesn't want to date right now as she just wants to enjoy her life, which is completely understandable. The issue is when I was at my lowest point where I was ready to end my life at a moments notice I tried to find a purpose for myself and seeing the person I liked being treated like garbage by her friends made me want to protect her and it kind of became an obsession to be around her. We are good friends her and I so it's not a stalker type deal, I'd like to make that clear. 

&#x200B;

I thought of being an inventor as I have ideas that could make me millions but I can't find anyone to work for me to design and advertise my work so I'm stuck working a full time job where I am treated like garbage by the other workers and the only reason I'm working is just to make enough money to live. Due to the fact that my career as an inventor failed I really just don't feel like trying to make a career for myself so I'll probably be stuck working in this shitty workplace making pretty much nothing for the rest of my life. 

&#x200B;

I just need help so badly because I've done everything by myself and I just can't handle all the stuff I have to do anymore. Thank you for spending the time reading this if you did. Please tell me any advice you may have for me."

I am starting to think that I need medication. The problem is that just thinking about taking anti-depressants makes my skin crawl. The feeling is more comfortable than anything I have ever felt.

for the last 2-3 years, I ( 27, nonbinary) have been feeling depressed, tired, and hopeless, in addition to my usual (social) anxiety. There have been good days too, but that was when I could distract myself from my thoughts. I'm also experiencing suicidal ideation, which have become a ""background noise"" - e.g. I don't have plans anymore or I'm not buying new stuff because I don't see the point, lowkey expecting to not be here anymore in the foreseeable future. I don't have any plans to actually do something, though. Couldn't do that to my family.

My feelings, thoughts and moods fluctuate around a negative baseline, I think - most of the time, I'm not happy but it's also not that extreme. Things are kinda... grey, resigned. But every few weeks, I experience a hard drop, and everything's black and utterly hopeless and meaningless; my anxiety's through the roof and I really don't want to be here anymore. That lasts for a few days, then I'm back to grey, still slogging through life without being able to see the future but without the utter despair.

I know I need help, but I'm very afraid of getting it. Partly because of general fear of taking action and having to live with the consequences. Making appointments, going to them, talking to strangers, opening up to friends and family - it seems like such an incredibly huge ordeal that I just can't imagine carrying on my own. Hell, I can't even make an appointment with my dentist rn.

And partly because I'm afraid of my family's reaction (""Why didn't you say anything? Don't you trust us?"" etc... I feel guilty just thinking about it). I kinda opened up to my mom - she knows about my anxiety re: my future, and asked if I thought I needed professional help. I said yes, and she answered with ""I don't think you need that, you're *so* strong!"" And now I'm insecure again. Am I weak? I don't know anymore. I think I need help, but maybe I'm just too weak to deal with life. Do you have ideas or something on how to overcome my insecurities and fears re: therapy? Thanks for reading."
3596,My loss of being a father killed me inside. (Gay Male who escaped an emotionally abusive relationship),w2bnx9,Leo_Sky91,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w2bnx9/my_loss_of_being_a_father_killed_me_inside_gay/,1,depression,False,"I had a friend that couldn't afford to have a child. So she asked if I would want to adopt the unborn child. My partner was happy to give me the opportunity to be a father(even though he had children already). I never got to meet his children so I thought it was a perfect chance for me.

I searched for baby supplies, looked for loans to start the adoption process, looked up the laws and proper places for adoption. I could see my daughter or son crawling on my living room floor. It seemed to fall into place.

Then I found out it could get pretty expensive and it could have to make us wait to get a house longer. I was willing to wait for a baby that I wanted since I was a kid. I would tear up watching movies with new mothers and wanted it so bad that I wish I could have been the mother and the father.

Then my partner, while I was discussing the possibility to get the money, gave me an ultimatum of being a father or being with him. I loved him and we moved across country together. He was all I had in this state. So I had no choice, but to choose him. 

I found out later (snooping through my friends Facebook) that she never had a baby or got bigger. That child was most likely aborted. That night I broke down on the kitchen floor (my ex made me only do things with his approval and that also meant having feelings out loud). I felt my stomach like someone was stabbing in my stomach. My heart was ripped out that night.

I felt dead inside and that love never came back. I finally after 1.5 years got the courage to leave my ex. Since then I have been stuck with a roommate who plays with my emotions and makes me think he cares. Then at the same time, I have no heart to give anyone. I try to feel again and either the guy does something to destroy me more or I run away from the good ones since I know I would disappoint  them. I thought this since my heart was a hole. 

I have been devastated ever since and I just want to feel hope again to hold someone that actually loves me. Someone who wants to make me happy, but now I am stuck with a roommate that plays with whatever emotions I have left and can't afford to live on my own. My career is in Phoenix and I love the state of Arizona. I need a miracle to feel again. I need a miracle to start over."

I slept with an ex of one of my friends. they broke up 4 years ago, my friend is in a relationship of almost 3 years, living together, almost like married. the thing is, i never wanted to sleep with him, i wanted to ask him for a favour, and he made me drink alcoohol and then it happened. it was awful. i felt so bad, i went to my friend and i told her bc i could not look her into the eyes. because i felt so guilty i got a medical condition on my skin, i wanted to kill myself. i waited for her to tell me if she will ever speak to me but she did not tell me, what she did was she told the story to our friends and they called me to talk. they surrounded me and judged me and pointed fingers at me and made me feel horrible. all of my “friends” did things like a did but i never judged them. i did not have a fair fight. when they call me to “talk” they did not even ask me to tell my part of the story they already made up their minds i did not tell them what happed before bc if i did i would have looked like i wanted pity. i would want to see any of them put in the same spot and tell the truth to that person and not hide the truth like i did. so what do you think? am i a bad person? like that bad?"

Yeah. I've been employed at least part time (20-35ish hours) since I was 18. Im now currently 21 and have graduated from college recently. Ive finally been working fulltime for about 4 months and I just cant take it.

Ever since I was in high school I would cry and dread having to eventually work for 40 hours a week. And now... im finally stuck here with no way out. Im miserable, im constantly crying every few days, and I don't see it getting much better. None of my hobbies or passions can make me enough money to live, so im forced to take a shitty office job. My job isn't terrible in the grand scheme of things... but I dont want to be there. I feel depressed and I just miss being home. I wish I could shake this feeling, but I seriously feel suicidal over this.

The thought of working fulltime for 40 more years makes me want to not wake up. Every night I cant help but sleep at the latest time possible because I dread waking up everyday. Even now it's 3 am and I have work in 4 hours... but fuck it. If this is what life is, I dont understand how people can function and be happy. I feel chained and cornered, and there's no other feasible option for me. I want more than 4-5 hours to myself everyday. Commute and work together take 10-11 hours and a normal sleep schedule takes 8-9 hours, so im left with a small 5 hours to myself everyday unless I sleep at 2 am. I cant take it, this isn't living."

Just to clarify I have never really been an 'incel' in respect of someone who hates women, but I am someone who is 27 and has never had a romantic relationship. As incels do I blame this on my appearance, I have been struggling with depression since I was 18 and I was first diagnosed with BDD in 2013, way before I had ever heard of a incels.

I didn't hear about 'incels' and the 'blackpill' until around 2016, and since then I feel like I have barely had a moment of happiness and my concerns with my appearance and belief that I am destined to be forever alone have grown unbearably strong, before then I at least had hope that I could become attractive to somebody now that seems impossible.

I really hate myself I am 5'5 and I would say I'm slightly below average in terms of my face. The self-loathing is making living impossible, I avoid forming any friendships, particularly with women as I am terrified of developing romantic feelings which they would never reciprocate. This had been working recently well but I have made friends with a women who is so kind, compassionate and intelligent, this has resulted in me developing romantic feelings for her and I am now trying my best to get rid of them as I know the hope and rejection will destroy me. It is not the fact that she would reject me that is destroying me but the fact that I know I do not even deserve to try, it's like if Google was looking for a new CEO I would never bother applying as I would obviously fail. It's this acceptance that I am inferior to others that makes me want to give up on life as I feel that is the only way this pain will stop.

I should say I agree with incels up until their blaming/hatred of women, I genuinely believe that I am not good enough and never will be good enough for a woman when taking into consideration things like the Bateman Principle. I can hardly blame women for not being attracted to me when I find myself absolutely repulsive, if I stand myself next to 95% of men I would not chose me so how can I blame them for not choosing me.

My main reason for posting is I need a way to live, my whole life is just waiting to die and I would much rather end it now than wait another 50 years of pain for it to end naturally. I have tried living without worrying or thinking about romantic relationships and trying to find hobbies, but I get insanely jealous of the men who are attractive and I can't live my whole life as a hermit ashamed and in fear of developing romantic feelings for someone. I know I can't live in a world where I will never be deemed good enough, and I feel like everyday is an immense effort not to kill myself and I don't know how much longer I can keep that fight up.

I'm really just looking for a way to live, I have tried anti-depressants and therapy to no avail and I no longer believe that I am depressed, I just lost the genetic lottery, and seeing lottery winners outside, on social media and on TV just makes me despise myself even more.

Hi im just another 19 years old. 2022 is one of the roughest year in my life, graduating into university, I was so excited like a child, I was so excited to meet all this new people in a new school in a new city. I was so motivated to make the best project I could ever make. I looked forward in what kind of friendship I will get that I will never forget once I leave this city. 
Guess what, I’m such a socially awkward cunt that makes everyone awkward whenever I try to speak. other than being able to introduce myself and ask people about their hobbies and stuff, I can never turn these friendship into something more, I guess it’s because English is not my main language but whatever. I have such a crazy imaginative world inside my head that the lecturers liked me at the first two weeks, now they just try their best to not let me express unless it’s presentation. 
Everyone seems to avoid me in this new environment, my 3 only friends(flat mates) would never actually come to my room and hang out, I seemed like an annoying fuck hanging around their rooms where they’re just trying to be nice and not complain about it. My besties are all over the world chasing their dreams like I do and as time flies, we rarely contact each other anymore. ‘Friends’ always said I’m such a nice person, a funny one too but they would never dig deeper into me. No one really understood me even if I showed them my true self and my dark sides. People come to me with all kinds of problems, mostly mental health issues and I always showed that I care about them and would sit there listen for the whole night even I wanted to sleep, but no one was ever there listen to my depression for even just an hour. It seems like my grandma is the only one who truly cares about me. My mother just wanted me to success in life and never cared about what I’m up to right now. My dad killed himself so early in my life he is just like a stranger me. 
I’m surrounded by people but yet I feel so fucking lonely. I thought I have a good ideology about the world and wanted to share it but no one cares about my perspective, or just went on shitting on my face. I thought I had my own views of philosophy about life but people just thinks it’s trash and that I’m being unrealistic, useless daydreamer and a tumor of society.

Im stuck in a loop from depression to normal to depression to normal, I feel like it killed something inside me but I never know what is it. Perhaps my dream, I have no intention to pursue my dream as an Architect anymore and I’m still hold on because of people’s expectations.. classmate telling me don’t give up!! Well fuck you, where was you all when I feel left out in the group, when I said something and no one wanted to reply? Where was you all when I nearly broke down while still giving out energy to all you hypocritical cunts? 

Into the 7th months of my new life in a new city, i never expected I’d be longing for death again as a kill switch to all this bullshit. I never thought I would want to use this as an escape again ever since the last time I think to kill myself. I thought I’d be better if I stop hanging around people that doesn’t care about me, but it ended in my feet deeper into in the mud. I feel so powerless, my family would still be fine living off from my mothers business and my brothers medical profession, I’m just a parasite sucking off my family’s blood. I feel like a stranger to myself ever since I finished high school, the popular outgoing funny and respected me was long gone. To the point that my mind seems to lock myself up to protect me, I feel so confused about everything going on inside me, stronger than any depression episodes as if I had an ego death, I feel so numb.. I just want to end this misery but I’m so fucking privileged, I had the resource to fly out of home to study, I had the freedom to live without my parent and I shouldn’t be depressed and I’m just an ungrateful little shit, some people had depression for 30 years and they are still holding on, people had no parents at all and a much worse life story than me why should I be depressed or I’m just not qualified to be depressed. This is killing me.. I just can’t stop laughing at how pity I’m right now, numbing myself with weed and lsd and cigarettes. Funny eh"

I’m the youngest son of a single mother and I was very sheltered and pampered, turning out to be a little spoiled and careless. I never paid much attention in school and was a totally non serious student. 

Transitioning to adulthood, I never had a sense of direction and purpose of what I wanted to do in life. I wanted to study abroad in Canada and eventually settle down there, since a ton of my friends went there to pursue higher studies after high school, however my mom was too protective of me and thought I’d adapt bad habits (I’m from a conservative family). 

Finally, I went to an average college as I didn’t have flying grades and had a lacklustre college experience overall, didn’t really learn much. Studied finance as a major as my sister advised me to even though I had no interest, again, no sense of purpose. 

Fast forward 8 years later after graduation, I’m still doing mediocre jobs that have shitty pay and conditions, not even close to what my high school peers are making. Though there were circumstances which obliged me to take such jobs as I had dependants and bills to pay, however, I still blame myself for being a shitty person and a little bit my mother as well for depriving me from important life lessons. 

I’ve developed severe depression and anxiety, and I’m totally ashamed of my current life. I hate my job with a passion , it was never what I wanted to do, and even though I keep applying I barely get any lead. I’m totally lost now and feel like it has become extremely difficult to recover. The other day, I was researching doing MBA in Business Analytics, but even I don’t have the money to fund it. I’m really at a shitty point in life now, and it’s all my fault.

Until 25 I only had 2 short relationships and that was mostly because I tried so hard for them, the partners didn't feel like being together with me. I feel I'm constantly being tested, I have to be amazing from every point of view, I just can't be myself because whenever I am, I am dumped or rejected. 

Just today the girl I was dating texted me she doesn't see us fit together and it's better to stop seeing each other. I asked for feedback and she replied she doesn't get too intimate (kissing, hugs) from the first dates and generally loves more mature men than me. Had I not kissed her, the relationship would've turned into a friendzone. I know that. It's always like this. I either jump into a toxic relationship where I'm the only one who cares or just friendzoned after a while. 

I can't take it any more at this point, dating is too painful to the point I'm losing all motivation to live. It's not the rejection itself, it's the thought nobody ever loved me and probably never will. 

I am living by myself and I'm just a lonely person most of the time but loneliness has its limits. Even as an introvert, I sometimes desire the company of others.

I thought I’d be married right now and starting a family in the next few years. Being a wife is the thing I want most. I know people say if you stop trying for love then it’ll find you when you work on yourself - but I have spent years doing that and no such luck. I know being a wife and soul mate to another May seem like a lame life goal but it is the only thing that I really just need to have happen and I wanted to have that for myself starting in my twenties - but by now I’m at the age where… by the time I meet someone and actually marry- it’ll be 30+ pretty much by the time the knot is tied. I am just really tired of doing life alone and have done it that way for too long. I can be alone but after so long, I don’t want to be.

One, because I'm depressed as none of you seem to notice, so I have a crushingly firm belief that there's nothing of worth in my words. Sometimes, I can barely form sentences and my brain is foggy and you think I'm looking at you but I'm not, you're just a cloud of smoke and so am I. I'm actually pretending and you have the nerve to say that and take me out of my bubble, but you know what? It only brings resentment, oh the resentment, I feel a fire growing in my chest, and thank you for that actually, I wouldn't have felt anything otherwise. I get so angry man, and I give the most menacing stare hidden behind a smile to throw you off, because you know what? You just don't say that kinda stuff without knowing what someone's going through.  Two, I have low self-esteem and social anxiety so I think anything I say will form a lasting memory of me in your brain and I will keep thinking about what I said for weeks so I just decided to keep it at a minimum and then words kept falling out till they stopped existing altogether. Three, I really don't like any of you so it's my mistake for coming to this place, in fact I should kill myself and relieve all of you of my shitty, boring existence, that's how your comment makes me feel, okay?

Epilogue


 Prologue:

Before I even start this über rant, beware about swearing, it's hard even to explain all of this without intense emotions that I regained after years. To summarize what this is about without poetic title: abuse, struggle, pain, learning, recovery & cure [to some extent]. And lastly I would like to thank for all those dauntless, smart people on Reddit, Longecity. Without your ideas, help, I don't know how long I would endure. I am proud that after all these years I can share something worthy, that may help others and pay my debts. 

Genesis:

From start it all was like big domino, had shitty beginning to be honest. I was born from serological conflict, and with pretty many many more issues. Poor development in overall manner from young age, and disabled immune system which helped me to catch every virus there was. Then going to hospital for many weeks [don't ask how common it was]. Later on, some hairs would fall off, again going back to my second home and I was diagnosed with alopecia universalis [misdiagnosed with alopecia areata]. Boom magic, I lost all hairs. Was kind looking like an engineer from Prometheus movie lol. School was a blunt blow for me. I was commonly laughed at because of my sickness and looking weird for other kids. To make it even harder, anxiety has developed itself and straight for a few years I was wearing a cap all the time to cover my head. Also school staff found out that it was too hard keep me with kids because later on I became aggresive due to those incidents and I had to work with psychologist wich after hard year found that I have underlying ADHD, well, fuck. Poor focus, poor marks, couldn't even sit for seconds, acted like a true caveman. Basically no friends, I had few before school but later I got antisocial and retarded pretty much. And finally I was put down to home teaching wich fucked up negatives even more but I was top kid about grades thanks to this. Now from my environment view: parents also had very hard youth and struggled with things that I do not want to drag out due to respect. Imagine how quickly with that background my parents wrecked themselves and then me. Mother went cold turkey emotionally and was pretty much robotic thus poor at giving me already lacking attention which I was craving like hell due to ADHD and mainly missing love. But I could always count on her about health. And father? Mostly working. He was incredibly resistant but a bit too overreacting, when trying to temper me. I grew up in a strict and pretty much army-like discipline for most of the time. Only family members that I could count on were my grandma, who is to that day one of most brilliant mind and kindest heart out there and my uncle, he maybe didn't understand me but was always open. Beside my psychologist and bunch of friends I was pretty much alone, judged, and punished by others. I am way way above that negative patterns today but I really would like to say: fuck those bastards wich hurted me deep straight into heart.

Later years and call of void, meds:

Moving on, middle school was pretty much the same pattern with one important factor. I gained new friends like: both Jacobs, Dorian and many more. And I meet in that age most influential person in my life then. My depression went incredibly further wich pretty much drove me to seek more help and go on drugs because of suicidal thinking. So basically SSRI's did what they was intended to: numbed me to level I could no longer cry, get angry, joy was feeling lost for longest time. It left me in void, only with something that resembled me. 

Out of those drugs i've taken [I don't remember names but for sure substances]:

Sertraline - seronil etc. numbed me to zombie like, fuck this SSRI

Amisulpride - made me extremely sleepy and haven't noticed anything good about it, I could sleep for like 15h, no joke

Fluoxetine - pretty much did nothing at all

Bupropione - this was best because it made me craving a lot of things like smoking, watching TV especially Dr. House [and if it's drug that mainly is dopaminergic and kinda noradrenaline one so].

Small breakthrough:

Selegiline - and that MAOI which I learned about existence about was game changer in hefty 65%, thanks to you all I went to doc for it, it wasn't magic cure but oh man, I will go back to it later.

About middle school and that important person back then. On some hip-hop group i've met girl, looking at it I wouldn't say that it may become such thing. It was pretty much only one person wich appreciated every aspect of my personality or at least what I thought. She showed me that she care about me, chatted with me often and I could say that we took care of ourselves, because I wanted her to never live as I had to, guard her from it as best as I can. At one point I had such crush on her that I would go to my first odd job to gather funds and go to see her because it was like 500km or more. But I would get then get rejected, but not like: fuck off, rather: let's just talk. After some time her argument was 100% right, having significant other at such distance would be painfull and unfulfilling. Time passed, and then my ex-friend wich used to be some kind of mentor to me, helped me to get from amoeba to really smart person. Way he written, played instruments and painted, knowledge about most things was unreal to me. He also was depressed but come on, if you would be such an intelligent guy and also good one you would break sooner or later too. I didn't had person that gave me before so much gifts and lessons. Speaking about girl: I tried my best to show her how cool I am, each time failing. Probably worst loophole that I was into. After 2 years I think my ex-friend would get more jaded by life and become someone like Rick from Rick and Morty. But he was way more successful in life. I spended more time chasing her than thinking about self development. See what lackings can do? It's just like narcotic hunger that obscure reality. One day he would start to act in a weird manner, cynical and interested in helping me to get what I would want. So they added each other on Facebook and chatted [worth to note about age difference, 10 years or more between them]. Soon enough she would treat me in a way that I would be pathetic guy, little I did know it was due to him. He made up that my goal was to meet her personally only because I would to get laid. Imagine my reaction, I was in awe how people can be fucked mentally. But of course, living in depression and on SSRI is in pair with high libido, like lmao. Quite the opposite like many people feel and know. Then to clean my name because my only target was to end this bullshit by any means, insomnia didn't help either. I showed her screens of our chat with him and that it was photoshopped to look like I am some sexual freak. She was sorry but to be honest it finally demised my respect towards her, unfortunately not other feelings despite that they were weakened by this. 

Time for high school and pretty much even worse emptiness and more rejections from girls. But then I met one that after some time was interested in me and I was inhumanly happy because I thought that I am worth something after all [I know how it sounds]. We got to get spend time with each other, get to know better and into relationship wich started fucking badly due to her past and her ex that I heard about. I felt like something was bad but the most important fact was that I wasn't sure that I did anything moral here. It was another swamp. At one point I shouldn't bother with her past but at same time I wouldn't have any future with her if I didn't act. But the most straightforward thing was to just let go, with a weak ego it was time for another year of lessons also a lot of pleasure but with great deal of stress and slowly creeping alcoholism. I had finally to get off those drugs because it wrecked me and my stress got back, so I decided to pretty much to drink every time I could. But to be able to work in a bar and not to be some kind of hobo. There was slowly time for my first serious job in the hospital which I was scared about like hell and not kinda into because I felt the whole time like crap, an important thing: anhedonic [nothing and no one was important or fun to me, my whole life was like being a robot]. I left gym, forced myself to work, play games or anything to get head clear and numb. 

Hard work beats talent, nootropics:

Much later due to hard work it became a lot better in many aspects, I would even smile and feel love but it didn't last long due to my feeling that I am again getting unhappy. Even due to anxiety I was in great need of going further. And I firmly say that I fucked up it well too despite my tries to talk alot about feelings of others and mine & needs. Then I resorted to nootropics which may sound like witchcraft but it actually helped me.

Noopept for instance made me incredibly mentally sharp and logical [was taking for it neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects], without it I could wipe my ass. 

IDRA21 made my negative emotions more and more stronger but not so memory like it promised. Double edged sword but helped me to get on track with myself. I was of course aware of potential risks and thus learning about neurochemistry as much as I could.

Ashwagandha calmed me to the point that I rarely raged at everything but after some time I gave it up. 

Rhodiola, L-theanine did jack shit or even L-dopa knowing about blood brain barrier, dosages etc.

GABA and Magnesium (in form of glycinate) helped me just to chill down even due to poor bioabioavailability of first one but some people claim benefits still with it.

I had one big success with helping my GF back then with L-tryptophan which helped her greatly with social anxiety. Repeating, I never thought about myself as some smartass MD, always humble and vigilant to not cross thin line. Nothing lasts long. Then I would go back to gym with great results over time because I was working my ass off to get back to shape and show what I am made off. Of course I would learn even more about how to make proper diet, supplements and my body and it needs. Because what is strong body without strong mind and vice versa. My relationship was dying because I would rather work on myself which was funny to what I did previously. Worth to tell about is my experience in hospital during working here. As I attended to med school as masseur [what a wild ride xD]. But I worked at a different position and the lowest one which I felt. Hierarchy is really strong here unless you have the golden tongue and wits, balls. I've met so many wonderful girls in my ward, due to my antisocial behavior it was pretty tough. Still I learned here a lot more empathy towards patients, how to get things done under stress, about myself alot too. True survival school. And saved lot of money. Those girls showed me that I don't need to act like clown or pawn to be liked or noticed. I owe them really much, and to my great surprise I meet another girl wich also made me charmed due to her caring nature, ambitious character and humor a bit awkward but still getting job done [if you would look at me then, Jesus, I am no one to judge xD], hard to not mention her stunning beauty. Kinda tall with incredible eyes like a cat, a womanly body, and a smile that could warm you up even on the North Pole. But this time I understood that I could feel nice next to her and nothing more, it was complicated. Anyone would agree that there is no point in ruining someone life or even trying anything more to just feel better for a moment. Later on I finally for god's sake realized that alcohol isn't my friend anymore, all those hangovers and my health. It made me more social and gave infamous afterglow, but at what price. I could use it as temporary tool nothing more. Only then to get into a trap of preworkout with DMAA [geranium] which is highly stimulating and dopaminergic but also blows your heart, thanks to genetics I have a tough one. Because of it, my gym sessions felt like a walk in the park and I was so keen to talk with people on it, make new friends, chase life goals, music was like SPA to my mind. But it wasn't enough and I knew sooner or later I had to give up on this awesome crap. My relationship ended sometime between those changes. I may say what I want but despite 3 years of something that I am unsure of. I've got my life lessons on how to be with someone, and pretty much all important aspects: talking, listening, caring, acting and looking a bit to the future. Previously I would just be: Mr. How can I help you, seriously who would like a silent, shy and boring guy. Some time passed and some more mistakes, again timeloop bla bla.

Show time, Selegiline:

Then fuck me. I said to myself that I need by any chance to improve my life and feel humanly again, not like living behind a glass wall. Numbed emotions (only anger and rarely joy, pleasure), weak social internations, my small talk was crap, anhedonic, or self loathing rarely. So I ended up sleeping for like 4h a night to find solutions, thanks again to Reddit and Longecity I found traces of other drugs. Magic selegiline. I was really stoic about it, like this can do anything? I was wrong, oh boy. At first with 5 mg sublingually, I know that oral is the default way. But this was long enough before I did know about: 5-HT receptors and their functions, D receptors, noradrenaline and adrenaline & cortisol functions, glutamate-gaba balance, BDNF etc, and NMDA receptor, brain parts and their pathways, and cannabinoid receptors and just way way more. It's just whole galaxy of knowledge, true beauty, big unknown still sadly to even greatest minds. Backing, 5mg did something, but after time. It kicked me a bit and made me talkative. 10mg then where it's magic have started about two weeks. I was again, feeling smell of perfumes, food. My taste got back, food was like porn to me, I would say that I wanted to go with someone with pleasure, stupid things like sun was making me happy. My touch got way better, I wasn't living anymore in steel armor. All my emotions that were held back got released but in an aggressive and anxious way. First time I cried. Because my life just got back to me. I didn't know what to say. Then more important changes has happened as I upped slowly dosage to 15mg to see what would happen [sublingually like rest] but just for short time, I was in mood to try things that always scared me. Sometimes I had racing thoughts and acted impulsive, something was lacking so I backed to lower dosage. Because there is important difference between MAO-B and MAO-A dosage, reversible vs irreversible if speaking about it, and time that brain get to return to optimal levels or little above after ditching drug. Not forgetting about tyramine, which seems to me like a myth, but those sensitive to it I would be carefull even if it's weak MAOI compared to Parnate or Nardil. Personally I eated a lot of pepperoni and not even the slightest change in my blood pressure showed or anything else. Also it's better to watch with stimulants on it. As it does pretty much same thing as them, also with 100mg of caffeine I felt my heart beating hard like Rocky, while I was working out. So I added, due to my hypothesis, a Taurine which balances levels of GABA and glutamate by binding to GABA. After alcohol abuse I would have for sure fucked up system. Not sure if GABA-A or B one or glutamate, or just the way they fire neurons up.  Next was something to block anxiety and no doubts, antagonism 5-HT2a by Panax Ginseng [250mg daily up to 500 cause of pressure], no longer that advised. I would become a monk, without weird outbursts of emotions which sometimes overwhelmed me, but at first it was about an unsure theory of HPA Axis and Amygdala relationship that contributes to anxiety when faced with chronic stress that also produces inflammation [worth looking into]. And finally to end stack was Ginkgo Biloba 500mg daily that would in theory help with many years of post SSRI taking 5-HT1a receptor sensitization to serotonin which would make me more emotional. Take it all with grain of salt, it's never that simple like one thing imbalance, that why I've tried to cover all damage done by drugs, alcohol, stress and to work negative patterns of thinking. It worked like charm, I got new life. Also selegiline made me kinda tough man, no longer I need to ask, feel remorse when it wasn't normal. Just take what I need, act now not later or day dream, say no when I want, be who I want. And finally to let go to all things that hold me back. It just made me living thunder thriving to infect others with best emotions and power surge. Also it made every goal easier: like on it I made my beard with Minoxidil 5% [Rogaine] and dermaroller every way pleasurable. When I look into mirror I've no longer saw bitchy me haunted by past but a jacked and sexy man that have universal knowledge and just want to conquer and master whole life. 

Epilogue:

To summarize kinda everything:

Years of hard work with psychologist, 4 times a month

Trial of error with drugs only to get it done by myself [I told my whole plan to my doc - she is way too awesome and caring for country like mine. She was happy, proud that i did my research before].

Living with fact that there is no shortcut.

Sometimes you have to understand that it's worth to enable your monster side but also it's mandatory to control it.

Mostly depression is bitch which silences us like knife on throat with toxic thoughts or feelings [no one understand my pain or I am alone, this is not worth to do] ALWAYS SPEAK YOUR MIND, FEELINGS, don't be afraid, many people might not care as they have their own hell but always there's gonna be someone to relate and work like team to get job done. It's better than never. I won't repeat most brainless crap aka never give up, it's for chumps that struggle with eating dinner but not mental fight. Nobody can promise you that it will be better, it might be or not. But look at mine progress, I had this tiny yet colossal manifest of will to live, like dim light in pitch black. You can do it too, anybody can. I always had this feeling to prove I will cut this bitch down, show prowess to everybody. I believe in you and I hope it might help somebody, it's my only desire. Lastly again thanks for friends that were with me in good and bad times, and all those souls. You did more than you think. And to family as whole but mostly grandma, mother, father, uncle & aunt and her kids. We progressed so far together.

I've polished it as much as I can so it doesn't become too hard to follow on, I hope.

Thanks, because I always felt that I am living on borrowed time."

3647,Customer Complaint,w1x2vu,lovetoreadeatsleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1x2vu/customer_complaint/,2,depression,False,"Good Morning,

I work retail as a second job.

Yesterday,  my manager spoke to me about a customer who sent in a complaint about me earlier in the week. 

The customer mentioned me by race (he's also the same race) and stated that I rolled my eyes at him several times and interrupted him several times as he was trying to speak.

He stated that my attitude will ruin the brand's image. He would like my manager to contact him about about situation. 

He's a young adult who looks like he attends a private school nearby based on the email address that it was sent from.

I am regarded as a manager at times (even though I'm not) as employees come to me with questions as opposed to asking management. 

I was employee of the year at my store three first year that we are open.

Another customer sent in a compliment about me which was later put into a ""magazine"" in the company.

There was another incident with another customer where I had a supervisor talk to a customer who was a bulk buyer. We have a policy against it so I brought it up and next thing I know, she complained to head office about me. Why have employee ""follow rules"" if they're not meant to be followed. 

Am I perfect? Far from it.

Why, oh why do people feel the need to send in complaints about people when chances are, they haven't lived a day in their shoes.

Do they know what has happened to me the past year; dealing with my dad's death, working over 50 consecutive days at one point with both jobs,  and trying to take care of my mom who isn't doing too well?

Do I need to end my life (trust me. I'd like nothing more than to not wake up each day), so that others feel better about them because they're perfect and can do no wrong?

Anyone else feel affected by their job that it's affecting them mentally ? All over a job that they work to add to their income?

Thanks for your time. I'd like to hear similar experiences if anyone would like to share."

It's stupid. But I assume that maybe someone would care. Maybe someone would hurt. I don't want them to.

Really, I hate living. I truly do. But I never want to hurt anybody. Hopefully, I can spin some sweetness into my suicide letter, and that can ease some of the hurt-  if anyone even cares enough to hurt- that anyone who cares about me goes through.

This strange nothingness in my brain makes it hard to have conversations and do complex things, as i cant really think complex or plan ahead or reflect.

I saw someone who had explained it like this:

«where one is disconnected from his personality, unable to visualize or verbally think, complete lack of goal-directed motivation, inability to plan, loss of creativity, inability to enjoy anything, inability to feel anything towards others, inability to ruminate, disconnection from others, loss of life meaning, loss of outside world deepness and so on»

Since a week my depression got worse and I don't have that much energy and am not able to feel joy during activities. it's not that i am not interested in stuff, its just that i dont feel the joy of a great view or whatever. I am also not active enough to hike up a Mountain or going Mountainbiking. 
Also she is working remotely now and during her work hours i am stuck at the place we are at the moment. So I asked if we could stay at places where i am able to fish, cause that's something I am able to do. And that's the only thing is asked for. 
Apparently that's no priority of her anymore, cause it's too much of a hustle In my opinion it's not. A week ago she criticized me for not showing happiness. Another time she told me i could smile or laugh more(translation is not that good)

I’m sure many people on here feel that way, but I don’t even mean it like that. I know that obviously if I kill myself, people will be affected, I know my friends and family  would be traumatized and I am not planning on harming myself in any way. 

All I want is someone to genuinely care about how I am doing on a day-to-day basis. I want someone to care about my interests and what I think about certain topics. I just feel like I have no one to turn to when I’m going through something and always have to end up fighting through it or figuring it out on my own. And while that has made me a much stronger person, I’m sick and tired of feeling like I have nobody by my side, no one to talk to when I need advice, no one that genuinely wants me to help them. 

I just feel like a background character in everyone else’s story. There’s always someone else that people would rather be with or talking to than me. I understand that I can’t be everybody’s favorite person, but it also feels like I’m no one‘s. If I didn’t have my mother I honestly don’t know if I could rely on anybody for anything or if anyone would even notice if something happened to me. 

It’s really just draining living each 24 hour cycle pretty much all by yourself and makes each day dreadful from the moment I wake up. I still go out and be social with my friends but always end up coming back even more depressed because I know that it’s just going to repeat all over again. I’ve had bad experiences trying to meet new people, a lot of them kind of disappear and fade out on me even if we starting off clicking. 

I don’t really know what to do. It just feels like I’ll never be good enough for anyone no matter how much I work on myself and try to better myself by going to the gym, reading, just trying to be a better person etc. it’s just hard to see point of life when you’re living every day for yourself. I can experience all the cool things I want in life but what’s the point if I just have to keep everything to myself.

However I’ve mostly become pessimistic as I sort to look at life more objectively because my openness and well intentioned nature provided opportunity/left me vulnerable to exploitation, I also gave greater weighting to my ideals and wishes whilst absent of the recognition that it was either somewhat unrealistic (though like many unrealistic visions they hold some glimmer of being attainable if xyz were to happen however they are unreasonable, unwanted by others and/or simply impractical) and/or other participants have their own plans, desires, wishes, wants etc. 

Possibly the striving for wishes to be fulfilled sustained me however simultaneous hindered me. 

By looking at life in a more real way I’ve come to a place of feeling pessimistic about many aspects of life, possibly unjustified at times. It’s hard not to have such pessimism pervade my life in   subtle ways that have led to great doubts whereby I then don’t give opportunities a chance to breath as I am cautious, vigilant and hesitant to experience yet another infuriating and disappointing outcome. 

I’m now less inclined to give opportunities a chance as my confidence in the possibility of positive outcomes is eclipsed by a deep cynicism, skepticism and a loss of faith that good will prevail to overcome adversity and manifest in a manner that will impact my life for the better and that it has the capacity to sustain… I experience pensive doubt and fear of yet another negative outcome after a series of disappointments. In this life you need people to be all in to make it, truth is very rarely are others willing to make the sacrifices themselves to make that happen when there’s always other prospects to suit their self interests.

I look at the world and I think… Most bosses generally are A-holes, there’s always someone that wants to put you down and keep you down to profit for themselves, sustainable long term relationships appear to be a rare occurrence, prosocial qualities and characteristics are mostly prioritised second to self interest (it’s natural to have your self interests however now the populism is grotesque) in a world whereby plenty is never enough and there’s no care for other than ‘I’.

I’ve turned gloomy and I must say I’m struggling for what is the point if you can’t hang you coat on anything because it more often than not comes undone and falls apart. Why seek to build if another is either going to move to bash it down or those that are dependent on the project are either uncommitted and/or in some manner compromised.

I am a Jack of all trades. I can quickly learn almost anything but because I spend time learning multiple things, I never spend time mastering them. So I turned 29 July 4th and still do not have a career oriented job and I have no idea what to to. I have so many interests that it would make this post ridiculously long. The problem I have with interest or hobbies is that they don't last. When I am interested in something, I go ALL IN. But that interest doesn't last forever.

I guess that’s because I’d feel like I was letting people around me down and I know that I have a lot of good to offer the world and others.

Covid and this cruel world really messed me up. Somehow I fought through my drinking issues that became really bad during Covid and I got a better job with my company that let me stay at home instead of working 7-5 in a store. Well it turns out that 7-5 was breaking me from the constant employee issues but those people and that routine were saving me.

Now everyday I struggle I fought with my long term girlfriend about alcohol, caffeine and pain for months. She has chronic pain and hasn’t worked or done much of anything for 15 years but I broke up with because I was tired of her telling me what I was doing wrong and being pressed and stressed about those things.

I hate myself for leaving and it hurts. I drank because my brain felt like it never turned off. It would make me have all kinds of sleeping issues when I would stop but they usually resolve themselves. Doctors want to give me sleeping pills when I tell them this but I don’t want to sleep more I just want to be able to calm down. Breathing and closing my eyes helps sometimes but once it starts it keeps coming.

How do I stop it from continuing to come for days and weeks at a time and being forced to hide it from everyone? Do I need medicine or am I just resigned to figuring shit out.

I’m an adult and I know my issues aren’t anyone else’s, I don’t want them to be, but I just wish I had support.
I feel like my boyfriend is tired of me and I don’t want to keep burdening him. He supports me financially and I already stress him enough. He’s also not in tune with emotions due to his upbringing so it’s hard to express myself.
My parents and I have a horrible relationship. They’ve been dismissive of my mental health basically since everything started going downhill. I felt real authentic love from my nana and grandpa but they passed away. 
I’m overweight, I have gross hair, my skin is awful, and my personality sucks. I have ADHD which is untreated and really bad so I sound stupid all the time. I overthink every little thing, my brain never turns off.
I have like one good friend but she has her own issues and I don’t want to burden anyone else with my issues because it’s not their job.
My other close friends was my cousin but she never answers me anymore.. can’t blame her. I’m annoying.
I have nobody else. I never will.
I have no job, no money, I’m in debt. Why don’t I have a job? I quit my job a year ago and haven’t gotten once since. It gives me severe anxiety and the thought of being controlled again makes my head hurt but I’m a POS.
I sit in my bed with chronic exhaustion, playing the sims, eating, and planning out improvement in my head but I just can’t, I don’t care anymore.
I would get therapy but I never have the motivation to call, I would need to bother someone to get a ride, and I’m already here so what’s the point? 
I become manic and insecure at times and lash out at my boyfriend, I get insecure and accuse him, I think about how he’s hurt my in the past, but like everyone keeps telling me, “the only person who’s hurting you is yourself”
How can I love myself? My parents don’t love me for a reason, I have no friends for a reason, I’m not doing anything in life and my brain hates me for a reason.

My life isn’t that bad, I should really be grateful for all that I have and I know people have it way worse than me. But I just feel so overwhelmed right now with my anxiety and depression.  I recently got married and I truly love my husband so much and I am so grateful for him every day. But I feel like I need some good female friends in my life as well. The few that I have didn’t seem to care much about me getting married and it hurt a lot. I confided in one friend (let’s call her Amy) how I have this fear of abandonment and I really needed peoples’ support.  Well she last minute bailed on the wedding and stressed me out the days leading up to it with a bunch of calls and texts talking about herself and how she needed to go to rehab.  I feel guilty being upset with her and at first was very understanding because obviously mental health matters and I did not want her to come if she was going to feel triggered in any way.  She claims it was for alcohol abuse.  Fast forward and I’m on my honeymoon and she texts me literally every other day asking how things went and apologizing.  I know she meant well but I didn’t want to deal with that when i was trying to get over my hurt feelings and enjoy my time with my husband. I really started to get irritated with her after a few days and so I finally sent a response explaining how I wasn’t mad, I just needed space because I’m trying to enjoy my honeymoon and I don’t really care anymore that she couldn’t come.  I also told her that it was hurtful she wasn’t there to support me and how I confided in her that I had a fear of people not showing up (which multiple people did).  She writes back a defensive response and I got a little snippy back saying how I’m sure she’s going to act like nothing is wrong and attend another wedding we are both invited to this weekend. I’m not proud of what I said, I just felt really hurt in the moment and didn’t take the time to think before I sent the text. She got all pissy at me and blocked me everywhere.  Now I’m having this overwhelming anxiety having to see her this weekend. She was the only person I knew at this wedding and we might be sitting at the same table.  I just really don’t want to go but I also don’t want to do that to the couple who came to my wedding.  My other friend saw Amy out at a bar this past weekend back to drinking.  I just don’t know how to deal with the intense emotions I’ve been having. Feeling betrayed, wondering if she was lying the whole time….idk. I’m sure she went to rehab but it’s just really hard for me to feel like I’m just not worth anyone’s time.  I feel like an outcast at work too. I just don’t know what to do to get more supportive people in my life. I’m hoping you don’t judge me too harshly for this post.  I know it may seem small but it’s been affecting me a lot on top of having a very stressful job and being in grad school classes and also being just given notice that I need to move out of my apartment.

But after a couple years in therapy and medication, my depression has taken on a new face. I’m depressed. Not about myself, but just….depressed. I love myself. I’m happy with who I am as a person. But I feel so empty and blank. I am not used to this feeling. It’s as if there is no reason. It’s like I don’t even have energy to hate myself. I just exist in this blank headspace. 

I’ve always been high functioning. Still am. But it’s so confusing. I go to work, I’m energetic and productive, downright talkative and friendly. Then, the moment I come home the mask slips off and I sit here utterly defeated, blank, lifeless.

This new depression makes no sense to me. How can I have my life together for 8 hours a day at work and come home and everything falls apart? Every single day. Where did my light and my spirit go? Why do I feel so empty and listless and yet not hate myself? Is this entirely chemical? I feel like I’m drowning in invisible water. There’s nothing wrong, but everything is not ok. I can’t identify what needs to be fixed. Till now there hasn’t been a single issue that I couldn’t overcome through therapy. But this? Where do I even start?"

I’ve always struggled with pretty bad anxiety and am diagnosed w generalized anxiety disorder. I’ve always felt my emotions very deeply and have always been an emotional person. 

Sometime In the past couple months, I suddenly completely emotionally detached from myself. And it’s a sensation I’ve never experienced before. I still go through things that would normally cause a lot of emotional distress in me, but now I just don’t care. The problem is I want to care and want to feel something. 

The best way I can describe this detachment is that: I know what I’m feeling in my head, like I can feel everything in my head, but it’s not connecting with my body if that makes sense?? Like Things that would usually have me curled in a ball crying such as my recent breakup. I am sad. I can feel the sadness to an extent. But it’s just not quite fully coming out. Almost like it needs to escape and be expressed but it’s trapped because the connections aren’t being made. 

For example I’ll be sad and crying, but my body feels excited, almost like it wants to laugh. This probably isn’t making sense and I apologize. I’m just desperate to know what’s wrong with me Bc I don’t want to feel like this forever"

Many of you as much as myself likely have ""safe spaces""; places or environments in which you feel safe or secure, hopeful or at peace. This can be an activity, too, such as walks, movies, video games, etc., doesn't just have to be a location. Really, anything you retreat to frequently when overwhelmed and need to feel secure.

For me, my own space on my family's property is my safe space from many worries or anxieties, and is a place I spend most of my time. Thing is, I feel guilty about how much time I spend there. I'm not as in-the-world as my siblings, all of whom experienced the same traumas as myself, but have been much more brave in their recovery.

The way I organize my atmosphere is much different from the environment of my family. One of the particular things I feel embarrassed about is having relatively cute and whimsical arrangements: stuffed animals, some cartoon playing, essential oils diffusing. Specifically, I have these silly elements because I have daily nightmares and it's nice to have any sort of positive stimuli for when I inevitably wake up.

It's not that those things in themselves are bad, but they aren't common for a 24-year-old male with no job and loads of physical/mental health concerns.

Any advice?"

I have been unemployed since 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Before the pandemic I was a confident, professional and well educated individual. I was working in luxury sales on good commission while I finished my medicine degree. I have a degree now but there are some issues that can’t be helped it seems. Years ago I had agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder to the point I couldn’t speak to family members. This was treated with medication and years of counselling. Then during lockdown all of these issues came back but I couldn’t get treatment for it and the medication didn’t have the same effect. I have applied for jobs that are minimum wage despite having a medical degree but when I go to interviews I basically make a fool of myself tripping over my own words, stuttering, speaking too quickly and not giving enough information. So I get numerous rejections. Because I haven’t had success with the medication again like I did years ago I can’t go on. I have zero friends so I have no means to socialise. The last time I was able to socialise outside the house was on a work night out years ago.

&#x200B;

Despite the social anxiety disorder, I am inherently an extrovert and I used to love being around people when I was treated, I became a top sales person for my company as well as getting great reviews from patients about my ability to communicate with them and speak to them like people not just subjects like other doctors. Now I am just defeated I have tried for 2 years to get back into it, but I have found this to be a catch 22 situation that is impossible to break out of. As well as other issues in my life with dating as a result of my illness that have contributed greatly to my depression. People on dating apps constantly tell me that I am handsome and I get invited to many dates but due to the fear of leaving my home and the shyness when on dates it always ends with me getting even more depressed a few days later when I am told that they don’t want to see me again because I am “too shy” or I have been told that my shyness made me seem uninterested but that wasn’t the case.

&#x200B;

I don’t see any other way out now, I am in debt which has made me more depressed, I can’t get a job or leave my home. I have no friends to hang out with or even speak to online. This isn’t how a man in his mid 20s is supposed to live I feel, I always thought I would be in a professional job starting a family at around this time in my life, but instead I have no life. So now I see no point in having my life anymore. As such I have already made a big decision. I just feel like I had to vent a little on here first."

I almost got laid last year and for that one day it almost happened, I felt on top of the world. It was like I knew what I meant to be a “man” and I almost got to feel normal. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out when she decided my roommate was more attractive lmao. 

But man, I’m absolutely pissed off at how pathetic I am. I’ve not only been to college parties, but I’ve thrown dozens and can’t even get a girl in my room.

I have decided that I have extended my time here far too long and that this needs to be amended. I am too broken and fucked up to be out here pretending like I can have a normal life. I am not normal. I’m fucked up in the head, probably permanently. I truly feel sorry for and apologize to the people that I have brought into and kept in my life, this fate is by far the cruelest for them. Dealing with the aftermath of a suicide  is a terrible and irrevocable disaster. 

I feel continuously guilty for having foolishly continued my life around them, for I have only exacerbated the pain in which they will feel. If I could die without affecting another, I would do so immediately. 

But here we are, 28 years in and nothing to show. A failure I remain and no change in sight. I don’t know why I must continue down this path.

To my love, god I am so sorry. 

I have tried so hard this entire time to do right by you, because you deserve that. You truly deserve someone who will be good to you and inspire and motivate you. You deserve the world, out of every person I have ever met, you were the only person who was truly authentic from the start, that is what I loved most about you. Even if I didn’t like every little bit, it was still unapologetically you. And that deserves respect beyond most peoples recognition. It was inspiring to me, I wanted so much to be like that. Unafraid to be myself, at all times. 

But I am not that, I am terrified and anxious at all times to be myself, constantly questioning my every move, action and word. I am unable to express myself, I always feel the pressure surmounting within. The pressure to be myself, but it cannot break past the wall. There is always a barrier preventing me from truly existing. This is a barrier that I myself have created, long long ago. It is a barrier that I have tried to demolish, brick by brick.

I am so terribly tired, so tired of fighting my own demons. I am exhausted, beyond any doubt, especially within this last month. I keep trudging along, hoping that I will perk up and that things will realign mentally for me so that I can finally realize that everything is okay.

But I am not, I am not okay. I am drowning, I am treading water and my head is dipping below, I take In breath only to find water in my gulps. I think to myself, when do I find land. When do I trust, when do I relax. 

I don’t. That’s the trick of it. You never do, you just go to therapy and find clever coping mechanisms beyond what you previously thought was effective (drugs)  and hope for the best. Everyone keeps saying

“ It just takes time.”


It’s been ten years, ten years of triggers, ten years of nightmares, ten years of wondering if I would ever truly feel at peace.

Ten years and I haven’t, maybe for a moment or so I do. But it never, ever lasts. I am always drawn back in, I am always tortured by the nightmares of my past. They infiltrate continually, unwanted and unwarranted but present they remain. They chew and tear and take bits away with every bite. I have thought time and time again, this must be the last bite.

But it continues, faith catches hold momentarily and then it dissipates, leaving only the memory of what I once wasn’t. 

I feel as though I survived through such horrors and unfortunately lived. I should have died long ago.

I should have never been born.

This may be a depression, I know.  But god does depression feel more like the truth than anything else.

I wish I could die and not feel the guilt of leaving them behind, I regretfully continue forward in their name. I don’t want to be here, I don’t belong here. I hate every morning that I wake up."

3742,I dropped out of two colleges because I was depressed and was also battling an anxiety disorder (still am),w1srz7,Creepy-Plantain-5448,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1srz7/i_dropped_out_of_two_colleges_because_i_was/,1,depression,False,"I'm 21, and at the beginning of 2021, I withdrew from my first college since my campus health center put me on Escitalopram (Lexapro) and it caused me to feel depressed and apathetic. My parents pushed me to apply to the same community College my sister was attending because it was convenient and they're overbearing (which is its own story). 

I quickly realized after starting 4 classes completely unrelated to my major that I had not done anything to improve my mental health, and I was only there because I felt I ought to be there. I didn't submit a single assignment for three months, I could not physically bring myself to do it. It may have been burnout - because there was this sense that I couldn't DO it anymore. Eventually, I cried every morning before going to class, I would skip and get a bagel; sit in my car.

Then, about three months in, I went through the strangely difficult process of applying to withdraw, which I did not have to do with my first university (to my knowledge). They proceeded to withdraw me from my classes. 8 months pass. 

I periodically had been receiving letters from that university asking for $4,790 to cover the 4 classes I barely took for three months, I was failing all of them when I withdrew. Recently, I received a letter from them (thick paper, so they were serious) saying if I did not pay them the $4K by July 25th, 2022, they would take further financial actions. That a hold has been placed on my account, I can't register for classes, or request transcripts - which is strange because though I unfortunately had a nervous breakdown AFTER the refund period, I was very clear that I wanted to withdraw from THE UNIVERSITY. 

I'm going to call the bursar office as soon as I'm out of isolation (I have COVID, at the moment) but the thought of it makes me want to puke because I don't know what to tell them. 

I'm a barista at Starbucks and I'm currently battling my issues with impulse spending. I am seeing a therapist that is NOT helping me and I don't have the energy nor money to find another one. I'm unmedicated and have been since I dropped my first college (I stopped taking the Lexapro very abruptly, which I do not recommend even though it had no affect on me). 

I pleaded to Pulte (philanthropist) on Twitter, dropped my Cashapp, but that's all I can think of to do. I only have $500 at the moment, my car is $130/month, gas is $55 per tank. I could pay that college in small installments but I don't want to pay off a university I barely attended for the next four years. Especially since I NEED to move out of my parents' home for my own mental wellbeing - which is not realistic, given inflation and the fact that I really want to live in Washington (I live in Indiana). 

I'm just ... at a loss. And it feels like the entire universe is against me but I know I'm catastrophizing. I haven't heard a PEEP from my first university but this second one? They've been asking me for money since I left. I had to take an exit survey detailing how much I would have to pay, what capitalists ... I'm so angry and so scared. 

And slightly disappointed that I didn't just ... suffer through my last two years like everyone else seems to. I tried telling my parents that I didn't really want to go to college and if I did, I would want to take a gap year and they refused to listen.

I would have stayed at this university suffering in peace, slowly deteriorating, emotionally if I knew they would be bullying me for money. And for a French class, Communications class, Eugenics class, and a Math class - I was majoring in Journalism! I had added a double major in Women's Studies! Waste of money. 

I'm rambling, sorry. I feel so stupid. I wish my brain worked differently and I could have just ... done the work."

My younger brother’s birthday is next month so I’m going to wait until after it’s over so I don’t ruin that. I don’t want to fuck up my little brother’s life but I don’t want to live another 60 years. Any advice is appreciated. Not in a great mental state at the moment :)"

I swore this would be the summer I get a gf but have had no luck I’ve been texted first by girls and complimented but it never goes farther than that. I have confidence in myself just can be really socially awkward I have good friends but I’m too scared to tell them where I am and have been mentally. I’m never suicidal I just think why work so hard to be let down everytime or why get my hopes up if I know the outcome. I let myself think being alone was the best when it’s not yes even if people are fake around you it’s never healthy to become antisocial but I feel I also had no choice with quarantine taking over my sophomore year.

I suffer from a host of problems... Chronic daily headaches, spinal stenosis which affects my neck, bulging discs in my lower back, IBS, GERD, anxiety, panic attacks with agoraphobia, and insomnia.

On June 29th I had a lumbar epidural and since then my lower back pain has been out of control. I wake up in the middle of the night with a 8-9 on the pain scale. I've tried heat and ice for the pain and it feels good for a few minutes, but then the pain comes right back. 

The last time I had a cervical epidural it did nothing and I told my doctor I didn't want to continue the treatment... It's to expensive for no relief. If I do anything that doesn't involve a pillow or headrest my neck hurts so bad, like 8-9 on the pain scale, and I have stinging pain all across my shoulders.

After my last colonoscopy I was diagnosed with IBS and told to take a daily fiber supplement along with medications. IBS has become a monster and some days it takes up most of my time. On bad days I could have 10-12 bowel movements a day (diarreah). On a good day I just cramp and cramp and have abdominal pain all day.

This has made my depression so bad that I feel hopeless and I don't think I'll ever have a good quality of life. I have lost interest in just about everything that I used to enjoy. I only leave the house when I can't get out of it...going to doctor's appointments. I'm not suicidal, but I wouldn't care if I went to sleep and never woke back up, because it starts all over again the next day. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I'm on a antidepressant called Viibryd and out of what I've tried, which is a lot, it works better than anything for me, but not so much lately.

3760,I said goodbye to my flatmate and my parasocial relationship with her.,w1e06i,linkenski,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1e06i/i_said_goodbye_to_my_flatmate_and_my_parasocial/,9,depression,False,"I am weirdly hit by a ton of bricks in the last week. The day before I went on vacation I saw my housemate moving things and I asked if she was moving, and she told me she's moving back to her country the day after. I couldn't say anything but ""Oh, really?"" and then within an hour I was taking the train to visit my family.

When I came home it was obviously vacant. She had left a letter to me where she thanked me for the time we lived under the same roof, and that she left whatever food she couldn't bring, in case I wanted it, and that there was one chore she couldn't get done in time to leave.

All of that is fine with me. The truth is, we barely ever spoke, and that is as much my own fault as hers. In some ways I'm even surprised she bothered to leave anything behind with me in mind (the letter moreso than the obvious leftovers).

I knew I liked living with her regardless. I found her very nice to live next to. She only arrived exactly a year ago, and just as with other flatmates I had in the past I could quickly sense that we weren't gonna be hanging out a lot -- because in truth I don't really hang out or socialize or go to events and stuff. There's also an age gap, but I got the impression that we both liked being able to live as housemates without feeling obligated to each other in any way. We didn't even plan weekly chores, we just managed whenever we felt like it.

Part of me regrets that I never got to personally know her better, but at the same time I don't think it was ever gonna happen. Now that she's gone, I feel genuinely sad, and I realize I must've had some kind of parasocial relationship. I realize I liked that for the time I spend being lonely here, I loved when I could hear her and friends she invited cozying about. Sometimes I could hear the sound of popcorn going off in the microwave oven in our kitchen because she was gonna watch a TV Show.

I will miss occasionally shopping and bumping into her in the kitchen and gossiping for less than a minute before either of us retreated elsewhere.

It wasn't a relationship but it kinda was. I'm struggling to cope that she's suddenly not here anymore :("

I helped at the homework club for Travellers (minority group in Ireland, lots of social problems and very low levels of educational achievement and even basic literacy) and there was a boy there who had just started school. He was five and called Willie. He was so innocent, smiling when he was doing his reading, what he could of it, and I felt so sad knowing all the hurdles he was up against in his future, the odds stacked so high against him, yet he had no clue with his little smile and happy eyes. He didn't even know his fleece was stained, and unwashed clothes are one of the signs of neglect to look for in children, I learned about that a few years after this. I'm thinking of him now and tearing up, how he must be fifteen now since I helped there ten years ago. I hope he has some happiness in himself. Maybe he's happier than I am.

I (22F) am having issues that no one in my life understands. I feel like my automatic negative thoughts and depression are robbing my life. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for the last 4 years, but in the last two months, it has been the worst it has ever been. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. In March, the work in the oilfield in our state shut down, so he was sent out of state. This lasted until June, and he came back home for a month. The readjustment was extremely hard on me. He left again in the last week of June and came back home this last Friday. He leaves again on the 22nd for 5 weeks and it is killing me with dread of him leaving again. I love him. I do not want to move on in life without him, and I only see myself and my future with him. He is everything I could ever want and my best friend. I know all of this, and yet the anxiety and depression makes me question EVERYTHING about my life. It makes me question my relationship (this takes the brunt of it), my friendships, and my work. It makes working extremely hard. I have been going to therapy twice a week, and I started medication. 

I just do not know how to cope or live with this. It is so so heavy. I reassure myself and give myself pep talks but it persists. My life is being robbed by this weight. I don’t know what to do."

This morning my alarm went off and I quickly grabbed my phone to shut it down, out of habit, in order for me to not wake him up. And I slowly realised that it's over, he's not here with me anymore.

After we broke up, I hadn't shed any tears for him. To be perfectly honest, I miss him, but I'm kinda glad that it's over. After 5+ years together, and living together for the past 2,5 years, I just realised what a burden we've both been to each other.

He had caused me so much stress (alongside my job and my abusive father) that I, at 28 years, had developed ulcers in my stomach and I'm now on medication for that as well, since the pain was physically unbearable.

Because I'm so confused about my feelings right now, how do you cope after a bad breakup? I don't have friends I can talk to, I don't like shopping, I am in severe depression, I don't like games or watching TV anymore, I stopped liking to read books as well, I hate working out and hiking...

3783,The guilt making me sucidal because i said something wrong to my female therapist and Why is she not accepting my apology at all?,w1qr8y,intelectloser,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1qr8y/the_guilt_making_me_sucidal_because_i_said/,1,depression,False,"I am 26 male and she is 28 female we had 6 sessions in the past 2 months. and in between, I expressed my feelings to her that I liked her. She did not talk much about that openly and I get that nothing can happen between us.

Eventually, I was getting obsessed with her and wanted her to like me back and always trying to get more of her attention which she is not giving to me. And that's made me feel worse.

In my 8th session, I decided that I have to change the therapist because I am crossing the boundaries now and I know my feelings are getting toxic.

I told her that I want to change my therapist she asked for a reason and I told her that I am getting toxic over her. 

She said is it your final decision?, I said yes. She said ok take care will let you know within a day or two if there is any therapist available for you. It was a 5-7 minutes session.

The next day I was feeling so bad, and I can't stop thinking about her that now I won't be able to meet her, I was devastated and broke, I was crying hard the whole day it was unmanageable and I started to get suicidal thoughts.

That night I sent a lengthy mail to her in which I vented that how she is not accepting me and how depressed I am. How she is not understanding my situation. 
She is not a good therapist she is faking care and she does not give a fuck about their patients and all that. 
I was frustrated at that time because I only had her email address to communicate with her.

I waited 2 days since I didn't get any response. I instantly realize that I should not have sent that email. I was feeling guilty as hell. Now the only thing I wanted is an apology.

Again I typed a lengthy apology email and apologized for each word I have said to her so far. But unfortunately, I did not get a response. And that's the time when I get completely broke and alone because she was not listing to me. I was again getting symptoms of depression because of the guilt I was having.

The next day in the evening I found her Instagram and messaged her there hoping she will understand how bad I am feeling about everything I just want her to accept my apology. I woke up the whole night waiting to light up my phone.

But the next morning I saw that she blocked me on Instagram I instantly messaged her on her second account and within an hour I got blocked there too.

I just closed my room and cried so hard. I was can't figure out what should I do? I sent a voice mail while crying and told her everything I was going through. And begged her to save my life but as usual, she didn't respond.

The same day I decided to go to the hospital to meet in person even though I don't have any appointments.

When I reached there I ask the guard if I need to meet her. The guard talked to her over the phone for a while and then told me that your therapist is on leave today and she didn't say when should i come next. 

I forcefully got into the therapy room because I was sure that the guard is lying to me. But the guard grab my hand and asked me to leave asap from there.

And I was waiting outside for 3 hours hoping I could see her. But I returned home disappointed.

The next day again I visited the hospital, I decided I just want to talk to her at any cost even if I have to wait the whole day. It was 9.00 am I showed my OPD card to the guard and he said wait here I'll let you know when she will come.

At noon another therapist called me into the room. She was the supervisor she said that you can not meet your previous therapist because the boundaries had been crossed and you will be transferred to a senior male therapist because she is not able to handle you because she is not experienced yet.

I said ok I agree with you, I just want one last session and want to say sorry. she instantly shouted at me and said why don't you understand it is not possible, feeling sorry is nothing it's bullshit. I was crying in front of her but she didn't listen to me.

They transferred my case to a senior male therapist as soon I confronted him I started crying again because I was broke and nobody was listening to me. 

I told him that I want to meet her at least once to apologize for everything I have said to her. And after an hour he is convinced and said I will talk to her.

While leaving the hospital I saw her but as soon as she saw me she changed her way and returned which hits me so hard. It felt like I am a molester or something like that she doesn't bother to see my face. I was crying in the metro.

In the next appointment, I saw my previous therapist sitting with her senior. It was a joint session. I was happy but at the same time feeling ashamed. During the whole session, I didn't make any eye contact with her because I was feeling ashamed I was just looking at the floor.

They were talking to each other about my case and they did not talk to me. And I was waiting for the senior therapist to allow me to talk to my therapist but in the end, he said ""ok, we will see you in the next session and she will not be here I will be the one who is taking your session""
I was still waiting that someone to allow me to express what I was feeling but they asked me to leave. 

I was getting more depressed, it was the worst stage of my life so far.

After a week on 16 July 2022, I decide I will send her one last email for an apology ( I indirectly indicated that I am suicidal) and asked her to meet at a place at 5.00 pm after work even though I know it was a waste. she won't come. But I was so desperate to say sorry to her.
Again I get no response.

I waited there till 6.00 pm and she didn't come.
Before leaving, I typed one last time ""Goodbye:)""

And now here I am severely depressed and broken even though I don't have words to express my sadness and guilt.

Every day I say my myself it was my fault, it was my fault and cry. And slowly it is now pushing me to the edge.

I have already written down my suicide note and waiting for the right time, not because of her, but just because I won't be able to carry the guilt I am having. 

Now I know I won't be able to seek any other therapist because I've lost the trust that they also won't understand my feelings.

And I don't know how to cope with this I am dragging my life. I have so much baggage and, it is already because I have Anxiety disorder mixed with depression and PTSD.

It was my fault, I always lose people to my stupidity.

I'm typing this late at night, looking out at the ocean by myself. I just got back from a club, where once again, I had no human communication.

I'm short, no girl I've met likes short guys. I look like a high schooler, most people look at me and laugh. Bartenders have been doing this to me the whole trip so far. It really makes me feel like I've already lost my chances at a memorable youth.

Because of how I look, nobody wants to talk to me. I really hate myself. I changed my entire style, everything to be a new me. Nothing.

It's almost been 3 years since someone's genuinely given me their time to interact. Everything in life just looks so fake, totally colorless. I always hear ""It will get better!"", I'm sick of hearing that, because it's absolutely not true. The only way to make things better, is to change it yourself and move forward. You have to chase what you want, you need to grasp that better future yourself. Someone like me, is completely incapable of that. I've tried for years, I'm done. I'm not fighting this stupid battle of life I didn't ask for all alone anymore. I'm this close to ending my pathetic life, and letting my memory fade out of existence.

My entire family has fallen apart, I'm the only one of my family on this cruise. I look around, and just see people happy. I don't know why I can't be happy too. I walk in this sea of people, all alone. If I wasn't there, nothing would change. So what's the point of living, if those who cared for me once are all gone. Nobody is left.

Life has given me a cruel slip of hand the past few years of my life, I'm totally empty. I'll never be full again and I understand that. I could so easily jump off this boat right now, but I don't have the guts to do that. It seems I can't do anything right.

I just wish someone could actually walk up to me, and acknowledge my existence. Why can't the laws of this stupid universe allow that to happen? 

Perhaps it would honestly be better, if I let myself go sooner than later. That way, everyone can continue living their lives, and nobody has to get stuck with me."

Everything I do seems to be only to survive: have a job, eat, sleep. I'm a very lonely person, living by myself with no nearby friends, no pet and just recently started a relationship that just threw me more into this dark place. 

Can't say I've got much love when I was a kid and definitely didn't get much or any until now either so I know my problem and what I desire the most: feeling genuinely loved by other people. I just want to feel appreciated and loved for who I am, not what I own or my skills. I'm at most needed. I wonder if I would cease to exist tomorrow if people would really care. 

Yes, I've read everywhere you should be happy by yourself, only give and not expect anything in return. Theory sounds amazing but I can't be like that. I can give a lot of love and care but there's a limit, I'm not some infinite spring of happiness. That was just how all my relationships have been so far. I did my best to offer my attention, to be affectionate, but I got nothing in return. I was the one initiating everything: hugging, kissing, anything. If I did nothing, I would probably be a bad partner and get dumped immediately. I really envy those guys who have amazing girlfriends who care about them. This time with the new gf seems to be no different. It's true we are into this for only 3 days but she seems to be the same. If I don't text her, she never does, if I don't hug or kiss her, she never initiates herself. I'm just tired of being the only one actively trying. 

I've tried so many times to not care about friendships and relationships, burned my mind into series, books, video games, the job and to what end? Everything seems pointless and in the end I'm still lonely."

And even if it did, will it actually help at all? There's nobody that exists that can just ""save"" me, and I shouldn't expect that from someone...

Even if I had everything I wanted, I feel like I'd still look at the ceiling and hate myself, and hate being alive.

What's the point in even living then? I'm just going to kill myself eventually anyways."

3801,I wanna end it all,w1lc48,Broken_pieces0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1lc48/i_wanna_end_it_all/,2,depression,False,"I (22f) have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. I remember first wanting to die when I was 9 after my dad had passed away. And since then it's me quite the journey. I've on and off self harmed since I was 14. I've tried to off myself 3 times since then. So it's safe to day I'm not in a good mental state even on a ""good day""
My ex partner (24m) and I split up 2 months ago. And at first I was doing fine. I was holding it together. I kept myself so busy between work and taking care of our two year old that I didn't give myself time to deal with the emotions. 
Well now that two months have gone by I just recently moved into a new place. And now that the majority of my problems have been worked out I've had time to start actually thinking about everything.  He put me through hell.  Yet I still do love him. But it feels like the person I loved is dead if that makes any sense. 
Because of this I've just been feeling worse and worse. I've lost 15 lbs in 2 months (I was 140lbs. So not really overweight even to begin with). My stomach constantly hurts. My anxiety attacks happen at least twice a day and that's with the medication I'm on for them. I feel like my body is slowly dying and I can't even control it. I cant eat cause I feel sick whenever I do. But the worst part of all is how badly I wanna end it all. I'm tired of feeling sick. I'm tired of coming home to an empty house after work. I haven't even had a hug since the breakup. I feel like everyone is nice to my face and horrible behind my back. (That's what my ex did to me). The only reason I haven't ended it is my son(2). But even with him I still keep getting closer and closer to ending it. I just don't wanna be miserable anymore. Every day on my walk to work I just daydream about a car swerving or ignoring the red light and running me over. Or the bridge I cross every day collapsing.  Literally any way of dying I've imagined it. I'm too much of a chicken to do it myself. But all I want is for some ""unfortunate accident"" to happen and end my life. I moved far away from my family to be with my ex down here. And now I can't afford to move back. I'm stuck in this lease with my landlord for 11 more months. I feel so totally alone in all of this. 

I've started to sh again. I've been smoking weed and drinking (when I don't have my son of course) to numb the pain. I've been wearing pants all summer (it's been in the upper 90s and humid where I'm from) just to hide all the cuts on my legs. And yet everyone thinks I'm doing good. They day ""you have no reason to be depressed. You have a beautiful little boy. You have a new place, you have a lot of good stuff going on"" and it kills me inside every time the say that. I'm sick of hearing ""everything's gonna be fine"" ""you're the strongest girl I know"" I'm sick of being the strong one. I have been the strong one my whole life. Putting on a fake smile so everyone thinks I'm strong when in reality I'm so close to ending my suffering. 

I remember as a kid I dreamed of getting married, having 3 kids, being the perfect stay at home wife who makes all the best foods, the person everyone loves. And knowing that's never gonna happen for me is like my dreams being crushed every second I'm awake. I won't have another baby (post partum depression almost killed me on its own) plus other medical issues after pregnancy. I won't ever be able to afford being a stay at home mom. And honestly my ex crushed my dreams of ever finding anyone that'd love me. He spent 3 years lying to my face saying he loved me while he was telling all his friends how much he hated me and how he was only with me cause of our son. He even bought my dream wedding ring. And ended up throwing it out once he decided to move in with his ""friend"" and leave me. I feel like even my son would be better off with me gone. Then he'd just have one household. With his dad who loves him. He wouldn't have to choose which house he wants to go to.  
I'm just sick of it all."

3805,After +10 years I finally went to a psychologist... but there has been 0 progress,w1e1d3,squalexy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1e1d3/after_10_years_i_finally_went_to_a_psychologist/,4,depression,False,"On February I decided to finally go see a psychologist, after not admitting for almost 12 years that I needed some help. The issues I've been dealing with have varied throughout the years and I told my psychologist a little bit of everything so that we could focus on specific issues, one at a time.

The thing is, I don't feel any progress and help ever since I've been there (I now had 7 sessions). In one of the issues, we talked about my weight and how I struggle with emotional eating and also finding the courage to go the gym (which I would postpone all the time, I feared going there). She asked me to write a calendar with the foods I've been eating and the portions, but she couldn't help me with \*what\* to eat and \*how much\* to eat (what is the calendar for then?). She also told me to check the days where I would go to the gym (yeah thanks, but what about the motivation to do it?)

And I did write that calendar, I took issues into my own hands and googled everything I could so that I could solve that problem on my own - which I did, I now eat better and healthier and in better portions, but I still struggled to do exercise, so I didn't check anything.

She scolded me for not going to the gym, telling me that even though I have no motivation I have to do it for my own good and asked me to re-write the food calendar and check the days, again. I didn't do it and I said to her that I wasn't feeling it, I didn't have any will or motivation to do that again (to which she said ""Why not? Do you find that hard or don't have time to do something so simple?""). She scolded me again and told me that we would not progress if I didn't put any will into helping myself... but what help am I even getting from her besides telling me the obvious stuff that you would find on the 1st page of google?

After the ""Why are you not?"" I told her ""I don't know, I just don't, for anything in my life. It's general."". So what she said was ""Ok, then your homework is to reflect on what's been making you feel like this and come back next session with an answer"". I told her then that I've been thinking about it for all these years, almost everyday, struggling with that in my mind and having no answer for it, but she still decided that I should do it.

I'm feeling really let down by those sessions and I can't pay for a more expensive psychologist because I don't have the money for that, so I'm stuck between not having one or continuing with this one.

If I'm in this subreddit, I know that I'm dealing with depression based on what I've been googling all those years. Deep down I know the issues that make me feel that way, but they are all very specific little things from every day that have no connection and pop in my head all at the same time when something minor happens. 

How do I explain to my psychologist that she has been no help, makes me feel worse and that my issues are hard to explain because they would need a whole back-story to get there (which means I don't know how many more sessions and I don't know if I can handle feeling getting stuck forever)?"

3808,I’m Unhappy,w1kgp1,No-Artichoke-9800,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1kgp1/im_unhappy/,2,depression,False,"My thoughts are fairly incoherent in this moment and I am unsure exactly how I feel. All I know is that I feel that there I something missing and I am always angry. 

In this thread I am going to explain my current life situation. I am not here to sound humble or nice in anyway. All I am about to say is factual as far as I know. 

I am a university student, (20M) with everything going for me in my life. I am studying Engineering with a focus in Propulsion and rocket science, I am quite muscular for someone of my frame and age,  I have a beautiful girlfriend whom I love and I have no reason to feel unhappy the way I do.

Despite all the things I have, I am angry and hateful on a daily basis. Nothing I do is ever good enough, and I fantasize daily about killing myself because when I look at myself in the mirror I see nothing but a weak child. 

I theorize that my emotions of this stage of my life are derived from some of the emotional abuse that I experienced as a child or perhaps many of the near-death traumas that I had when was in highschool. Many of the awful things I experienced from my parents I had forgotten and only recently remembered since I have been in college. When I was in highschool, I worked in tourism during the summers. One summer, a coworker of mine had put a switch blade to my throat in a frenzy caused by him not taking his meds. I remember this event clear as day. Even the little things like the smell of the soil and the sound of the birds in the woods. I remember being so afraid yet Judy a few weeks later, it was as if it never happened. It was only recently, 4 years later that I remember.

I remember getting my ass beat in middle school and highschool and I remember blaming myself for it because I was nothing but a weak, skinny little boy with no backbone. Since the beginning of highschool I began working out and training martial arts. I am now muscular and more than capable of defending myself and I often step in to defend people around me.

I am also struggling with my faith and I pray that someday soon God will reach out to me and offer me guidance because frankly I don’t know what to do with myself anymore."

About a year and a half ago I took on way too much work; I managed two emergency homeless shelters for the winter (7 months) through my position as an Employment Counselor for a youth employment program. It became too much, not many people around here want to work with the homeless population so I'd have people quit after a shift or blowing shifts off. I was only told I could hire so many casuals to cover so when they already got their hours, I'd have to work. The longest day I did last year was 18-hours without a lunch break, I would work atleast two 16-hour days a week with the most being 4 and two 8-hour days By the end of those 7 months I was very suicidal. I was told I wouldn't have to do it again this winter so I was really happy about that for maybe three months, until I was told I had 3 weeks to get another shelter set up. I did it, but started having breakdowns at work. I got in to see a therapist and he was concerned after calling me just to schedule only first appointment. Anyways, I managed one shelter plus my youth program for 2 months this year, asked for support, like an assistant manager or even a supervisor just so I could shut my phone off every second weekend. My request was denied, I handed in my resignation. My boss decided to keep me on just doing the Employment Counselor job. That is up until last Friday when he walked in my office to let me go. I've worked 9 years of my life there, I'm 30 right now and I feel like it was a complete waste. Now I have an apartment I can afford past next month and I've been laying in bed for the past week. I'm not feeling very suicidal, mostly just depressed so any supportive words would really mean a lot. I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday so if nobody comments I'll just have to hang on for a few more days. Thank you for taking the time to read this, you don't know how much I appreciate it."

I was first hit with extreme anxiety at 13 which left me shaking and having breakdowns because I was terrified. A depression followed some months later and then a severe bout of derealisation and depersonalisation which lasted until I was 16. It ended and I thought that was that but it wasn't. I had a week of feeling euphoric, I was excitable for the first time in years and was rushing around full of energy. I felt wonderful. After about 6 days of that everything seemed gray again and the emptiness was extreme. I've had more of these 'ups' but they're more often just high energy and more irritable with some excitement though it doesn't feel like it was so good looking back.

I get exhausted by my thoughts and it's like my head is racing. I don't for the life of me understand why I'm so impulsive and made bad decisions even though I know better. It's like something takes over me. I'm told about how hyper I am all the time and giddy throughout the day even when I don't feel up. I suppose I fidget a lot and am restless a lot. I could leave the house feeling calm and then all of a sudden feel as though I've taken something as I feel wired and even paranoid somewhat. People can seem to appear out of nowhere and it freaks me out. I feel as though sometimes I go so fast I want to stop and slow down but I can't until I snap out of it. I felt and experienced this a long time before I started drinking a lot and using drugs recreationally. I just never feel truly stable or fine. I am full of anxieties and feel as though I'm just morally screwed.

It's so confusing because I'm not depressed or dealing with anxiety or mania or whatever it's like a mix of all and all at once each day. Sometimes for hours or a day, I'll feel that wired-up feeling. I just don't feel stable. I guess I think about death a lot though never intend on doing it or hurting myself ever. I just imagine myself dying a lot. I'm so confused, what could this be. 

I know no-one are professionals here but what could this be, by the sounds of things. That would help me get the ball rolling and gain a bit more clairty. Thank you all in advance :)"

I have abandonment issues I guess… Also from my post history you’ll be able to tell drinking has been a problem for me aswell. 

My partner suffers from depression and is being treated for it. Mostly he’s doing great and has gotten lots better over time. However every now and then he gets depressive due to bad sleep, stress or something similar. Usually it gets better pretty fast though. 

When that does happen, his depressiveness triggers my anxiety and abandonment issues. Because he is less enthusiastic, less affectionate and more irritable, it makes me immidiately jump to ”he doesn’t love me anymore” mode. Even though he tells me he is feeling depressed. Rationally I know that’s dumb, but my insecurities run so deep I’m essentially unable to control my need for reassurances in those moments.

Now normally you'd be happy that you're with people you know, but I wasn't that nice of a person in elementary. To put it simply, I was a bitch. From kindergarten to 3rd grade I was mean, rude, and extremely sassy. In 3rd grade I had this person in my class. I'll keep it short and just say that I cyber bullied her. It was a one time thing but I still continued to talk about her behind her back. After that I never had her in my class again. She wasn't the only person I was mean to, and she certainly is not the worst I've been to a person. In fact I mostly bullied one of my friends. We were a group of four and I would always purposefully exclude her. I tried isolating on of the girls that I considered my ""best friend."" I wanted her all to myself so I did just that. I scared away her other friends and became possessive and obsessive. My family situation at the time wasn't the best but that's still no excuse. Looking back I hate myself for everything that I've put them through. I would do anything to take it all back. Of course since 3rd grade I've changed. I have matured and became a nicer person. I have made real friends and always make sure to keep myself in check. I know people can say, ""Oh, but she was young so it's fine."" But it's not fine. They say I'm a good person but I really don't think I am. I know that I'm bad and horrible. I know what I did was wrong. I know that no matter how many times I apologize it's doesn't fix anything. I admit to my wrong doings but I still feel guilty. I feel like I should repent more but I don't know how. Honestly I'm so hung up over this that it made me fall into a state of depression. I think this is probably one of the main reasons that I have such bad social anxiety. I'm trying my best to make my life hell. I need to suffer the same that I've made others. I've starved myself, cut myself, threatened my own fucking life. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like by acknowledging the problem, I'm just running away. I've confronted it so many times but I still can't do anything. Someone please tell what do it do? How should I feel? I'm so scared of someone finding out about this and them hating me.

3831,I am exposed and completely empty. I need advice.,w1nay3,lightskinavatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1nay3/i_am_exposed_and_completely_empty_i_need_advice/,1,depression,False,"I have always struggled with depressive thoughts but have had found various ways to cope. I have always had something to work towards. When I was in my teens it was occupying myself with the future. Getting out of poverty, getting a nice car, graduating college, getting a nice job etc. I ended up doing all of those things through sheer willpower and during the dull moments I would play videogames. I didnt know how big the void in my heart was getting because I was so distracted. I didnt even process depression because survival took up all of my conscious effort, looking back I was a very toxic person, i couldnt really feel anything.

I thought I had it all figured out but When the dopamine from these material achievements faded I started to workout at the advice of many. This became my obsession on top of what I mentioned above and I am now almost in the best physical shape I can be. I have been working out for years daily and once again, never really looked inwards or sat with myself. Now working out is simply a hobby, the  bandaid from working out is gone.

I decided about 4 years ago to work on myself fully and wholeheartedly, no more numbing the pain, no more apathy, etc. so i could acknowledge and beat depression. It worked to an extent but It kinda turned into toxic positivity also enlightened me to the fact that I was in an abusive  codependent relationship that I thought I needed to fix. I got out of that, 6 years I felt I waisted but I did feel better when leaving, 0 heartbreak.

A year later and everything has fallen apart and I dont know what to do. I have become so much more knowledgeable about how I work as a person. I know my parents neglected me emotionally and I really dont have anyone to turn to. I am alone with myself everyday. I know I am codependent and have toxic cycles where I put my happiness into someone else. I am trying to heal the right way, no substances, no women, no bullshit, just by processing everything....people say I will come out of this phase even better but I just cant see the light at the end of the tunnel. Work, home, sleep, alone with myself everyday is too much.

I dont know how much longer I can keep doing this, I was much happier when I had things to fill the void with, I am so unhappy, the only positive is that I am more empathetic with people in abusive relationships because they say the grass is greener but I just cant see it right now.

Any advice for me? I already workout and take care of myself, already have a good job, already did college, its just so hard for me to see the point of doing this over and over again. I am trying to heal but I was much happier when my life was more toxic. I just want the pain of everyday existence to end. I feel like no one understands how I feel, I feel isolated even though I do have people in my life I could turn to. It sucks not being in control. Sorry guys I've never been this low before. How did I let myself get this low.

&#x200B;

edit: I have been sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Quit my job ( i have money saved). I just sit outside or with myself. I journal, talk to myself, self coach, I just am struggling. I dont have health insurance currently, and am afraid to speak with someone because I feel like I dont know myself....I know I need professional therapy but I have heard nightmares about it? How is that process? I really do want to change this outlook. "
3832,Some Thoughts About My Life,w1ikln,Cooltific,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1ikln/some_thoughts_about_my_life/,2,depression,False,"Do you ever wish to be a tree? Rooted in the ground, feeding off the sun, your awareness small and still like a pond?

I've frequently felt throughout my life that being human is a scam. Worry, regret, fear, anger, resentment, anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis. Young, old, male, female, single, married, rich, poor, religious, atheist. Life feels like a wheel of suffering that only ceases to spin upon your death, assuming this life is all we have. (Even if we go somewhere else after death, we'll likely manifest within another wheel of suffering...) I want to find that golden egg that will allow me to tolerate my past, present, and future, but I can never find it - likely because it doesn't exist. It definitely sells though, doesn't it? Become X and you'll be happy. Think in Y way and you'll be happy. Associate with Z people and you'll be happy. Believe in our deities and you'll be happy. I'm just at the point where I honestly want to quit. Perhaps not through the means of suicide, at least not literally. Rather by committing myself to not give two f\*cks about my life or anyone else's. Obviously, it isn't possible, because I need to ensure my survival, and I actually do enjoy caring for others and being good to them (plus other people can be an asset at times). I don't know, it's just stressful that I spin into mild contentment, then back out into suicidal despair and violent anger - repeatedly, endlessly. I do have a doctor, I am on medication, and yes I am seeing a therapist. I have improved significantly, but there are still many moments where I want to give up completely (or go on a rampage and burn everything down). Anyways, these are my spontaneous thoughts as of tonight. Thanks for reading, and I appreciate your responses. I hope you are all doing well. "

Ive worked 11-14 (ive lost count) jobs since i started working when I was 15. For all but one of them, I ended up leaving because of my depression. It would start out great, full of excitement and drive to be on time and do a good job. Im a good worker, but I always end up being a bad employee. I genuinely liked all the places Ive worked, including the work, people and environment, but it always came down to me leaving because of my mental health. 

Ive tried being open with my bosses, and one of them was completely understanding, having been through and struggling with a lot of the same things. She even gave me the option that if i needed time to get my head on straight that i could just drop work and let her know and she'd find a way to cover for me, but then anxiety started to kick in and I couldnt go back. The others tried to relate, but in the end called me lazy and couldnt believe me when I tried to explain my symptoms. 

I know that im the problem, i know that everyone else tries their best to accomodate me and its not their fault that this keeps happening. Its not their responsibility to help me or put up with me. I know they do the best they can with what they have, and im not trying to place outward blame on them or my mental illness. This is part venting part asking for advice on how to deal with some of these things. 

Some of the symptoms i have that make it hard for me to get into work is lack of motivation, lack of ability to get out of bed or get dressed or there have been occasions where i did both of those things but then froze and couldnt open the door not matter how long or hard i tried, or even drove to work but couldnt get out of the car. If emotions run high the night before, ill completely forget that i even had to go to work, or sometimes what the day is, which i have admitted and was told it was hard to believe, which is where the lying comes in. 

Im too good of a liar. Having lived with this for this long and being told it isnt an excuse, i started lying about it and over time figured out which ones worked and which ones didnt and how often they could be used. Im not trying to make this out to be bragging or like its a good thing, just trying to explain to see the problem. Ive been seeking help for a while now, therapist/psychiatrist/medication type help, but I cant stay accountable enough to get to the first appointment. Ask a friend or relative? Heres where the lying starts. Ive done therapy and psychiatry before, so when i dont end up going i know what to say so i dont ""get in trouble"" with the person keeping me accountable. Another issue ive run into is that i cant get a decent provider appointment unless its 3 months out, currently have one scheduled in about a month that i set 2 months ago. Cost has also been a problem but im not going to go into that. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to manage this or cope with it in the time before i get help, assuming i can afford it?"

It is in the grips of despair that I am here listening to the old recordings on repeat wishing that I could see you again. This simulacrum doesn't do you justice. I miss you and I love you. I hope that you are out there somewhere. I regret not calling you enough because I was too tired or too busy or whatever stupid excuses I made to myself, but that doesnt matter now. It feels like nothing does. I'm going to miss all our late night phone calls where we talked for hours about everything and nothing against the backdrop of our rational pessimism. I am going to miss trading poetry and bouncing ideas back and forth about all things music and philosophy. You were a kind and genuine person and that is so rare to find these days. I am sorry I took that for granted. Most of all I am sorry we didnt get together again sooner before all this happened. I was looking forward to reading the rest of your book someday, but I suppose the first 3 chapters will have to be enough. A friend of ours told me earlier that you were the happiest she had ever seen you when we were writing together and for that I am grateful. I just wish we could have done it more. In fact I'd do alot of things I wouldn't be proud of to see your face and hear your voice again. You are a very special person to me and I love you very much and I could probably write on and on about it up to and beyond the edge of my sanity, but I will spare anyone who reads this the annoyance. I LOVE YOU AND YOU WILL BE SORELY MISSED BY EVERYONE WHO KNEW YOU THE WAY I DID. YOUR LIFE WAS OF VALUE AND IT STILL IS. 

If god exists he knows he got the better deal when he made us trade you to him for a stone.

Maybe in the Next Life,

Some background information, I’ve suffered from cycles of depressive episodes that come in times of stress or at random points(love the chemical imbalance-NOT). Usually they come in cycles of about 2-4 months, where I’m absolutely fine in between them. Usually I wait them out and try to do things to keep my mind occupied, but it doesn’t always work. I had a really bad episode in March where I had to seek crisis counseling and possible in patient treatment. The thing is that these episodes only last 1-2 weeks and vary on severity so I always feel like I’m overreacting and don’t need to seek consistent treatment(I off and on see a really good therapist but due to school/work it’s been difficult to get on a schedule). I tried seeing a psychiatrist during one of my episodes to get on medication but had to break up with that doctor due to some REALLY unprofessional things they said. I wont divulge into details but let’s just say it was heartbreaking to not feel heard and like I crazy.

My heart hurts and I go into crying spells that last for days. Each episode I have seems to get worse and worse. I’m struggling to breath and function without feeling exhausted. My friends, family, and significant other are AMAZING and supportive but I feel shame and anger that I have these great people in my life and I still can’t be happy. It’s a growing pain in my chest that creeps up on me when I’m alone. Last week I burst into tears at work when one of my coworkers asked how I was doing. 

TLDR: I’m struggling with depressive episodes and am seeking advice/support on how others are handling their own. Anything is greatly appreciated!"

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this while my body continues dealing with withdrawal from the SSRI? 

I do see a therapist. So looking for more general advice. 

I try to eat healthy but you know how it is for a young person living alone these days. I do work out regularly. I have close friends. Like I have “everything” except for what’s missing inside. I don’t like (as much as I do like) how viibryd filled that void but with the sexual disfunction and my general feeling of not being on multiple medications for an extended period (maybe even lifelong) amount of time makes me want to transition off."

The last few weeks I was slipping into something that felt like a milder version of an episode, and I tried communicating that with my therapist. The thing is, despite whatever symptoms I might be experiencing, I /am/ capable of seeming okay for 50 minutes. I don't know if it's some kind of coping mechanism, but I really don't seem depressed while talking about it. In fact, I even laugh and make jokes about it. Last session he told me that he finds it a bit unusual and that it seems as if I was talking about an entirely different person, and I can't blame him. In that moment I felt like the biggest impostor and questioned myself if I was even depressed. I'm not sure how to communicate that with him-- I am really afraid that he might think that I'm lying for some reason?

 I'm scared.
 I am afraid of myself.
 I would like all this loneliness to disappear, but it always comes back, each time more violent and so each time it drags me deeper and deeper into the lake of black and cold water.
 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for what I could do, for the people who are close to me.  I realize that I would give him immense pain, but the truth is that although I have all these people around me, I do nothing but feel alone.
 I do not do it with malice or ingratitude, it is simply an emotion that grows stronger and stronger inside me and scares me.
 For this I leave this memento, as a reminder for what I am trying to go through.  Sooner or later I wish I could come back here and reread these messages, thinking about how I managed to get out of them.

Then literally 4 weeks after the wreck that exacerbated my PTSD, we found bedbugs in our apartment and have been working through the psychological terror and domestic upheaval of the bedbugs. I had to add on another class to my summer course load to qualify for financial aid which we’re depending on. And the week after the wreck, my antidepressant dosage got reduced, primarily because of side effects. 

All that considered, I was mostly okay until the bedbugs happened. The psychological effects of going through an infestation are severely underreported and underrated. We live in an apartment building, and they came from somewhere in the building. And every time I talk about it with someone, I feel the need to explain away why/how we got bedbugs so they don’t think that we’re just gross, though our domestic responsibilities definitely get neglected. I’m gradually becoming sensitized to many of the mentally difficult things that our society seems to mock. Forced empathy is rough. 

Like I was saying, I was fine until the bugs. They just also lined up with a midterm, the difficult half of our semester, and the likely related relationship discord we’ve had since they started. I can’t even imagine being intimate in my bed right now, and we’ve been keeping our occupation of that room to a minimum, so things have been ROUGH of all the levels. 

I’m constantly primed to react strongly to something from my partner or friends. I’m remarkably sensitive and definitely not in a “good way”. I feel like I’m just sinking deeper into despair. My professors have thankfully been gracious with deadlines, though I haven’t actually missed any. We were told, “go ahead and turn in everything,” three weeks earlier than expected. I told her I would get it done, but not today, and she was receptive thankfully. And I’m slowly chewing through my assignments, but that’s just leaving me even more tired and overwhelmed. I looked at my syllabus and if I miss a clinical day tomorrow, I have to makeup the hours, so missing it for the sake of mental health isn’t an advantageous option. Which is really ironic because I’m currently in my mental health semester, but that seems pretty consistent with the career field. 

I feel like I have no way out except through. And I feel like getting THROUGH is killing me. Dropping out or taking a semester off isn’t an option, and will have a more damaging impact than pretty much any other route I could go. Any other guidance or suggestions are definitely welcome. ❤️"

Hardly ever do I initiate. Too scared! I get this anxiety attack and my chest starts to constrict, it becomes hard to breathe... I end up walking away instead of saying Hi. I should have gotten over this a decade ago! I mean, I've gotten better, but only a little bit.

I've had 1 serious relationship in my life and that only happened because I met the girl in a chat room and we dated online for a year first. That was over 10 years ago!

This is something I get depressed about the most. Feeling like a complete looser, watching everyone else live out their oh-so-happy lives kuz they have someone while I'm here alone and miserable. I especially hate weddings! Nice way to smear it in my face that I'm a miserable reject.

I admit I've dated here and there but it's always the same thing. I have to keep the conversation going kuz the woman doesn't want to contribute. Maybe that means I'm ugly or uninteresting or both. Typically it's always 1 date and that's it.

So how? How do you get over this garbage? What should I do?"

I have autism, depression and anxiety and have had past psychosis and 2 mental health illness episodes where I was unable to function properly.

When I was going to finish college, I knew I need to make friends, I knew that if I don't I am going to be lonely, well turns out that is exactly what happened, I didn't know how to make friends or talk to people, some guy would come and speak to me but I didn't know how to become friends with him, it was difficult so they just let me be eventually.

In a way I feel like I am abiding by my Mom, since she abused me in childhood its difficult for me to do anything on my own without thinking how my Mom will think and judge about what I am doing so therefore I decided to stay in my room on the computer and not change in order to not create an issue.

I am SICK AND TIRED of LIVING LIKE THIS, I want to go outside, have friends, socialise, have fun, all of the things that should have happened when during this age, now I am getting older and didn't do any of those things, it is so depressing.

I am going to try and go for a walk today outside, I have to force myself to go, I don't usually take walks on weekends because I am afraid of there being more people outside than on weekdays.

Unfortunately this lead to a blood stain appearing on my shirt. I tried to hide it but  my school counsler saw it and immediately. informed my parents about it. As a result my parents started sending me to a psychiatrist.

However, after one month my parents randomly stopped sending me to that psychiatrist. When I asked them about it they told me that I appeared happier and that my state in late 2021 was a small phase so they felt I did not need to go to that psychiatrist. The problem is I still don't feel great mentally and I still have urges to cut myself (Although I haven't acted upon them ever since I've been caught). To make matters worse on my last session I was given a depression and anxiety test and I never found out my results leading to me in more confusion on whether I have a mental disorder or not.

Now mind you, the last time I was in a serious relationship  was the age of 22. I knew my thinking was messed up, I swallowed my pride, and tried my best to adhere to all of the principles of the 12 steps and many other suggestions on how to basically be a better person.

Well, last August I decided to put myself back out there because I was making like 65k a year, had my own place, my own car, in good shape, I felt like I was ready. Apparently I was gravely mistaken. I went out with about a dozen different people from last August until now. It was nearly all the same thing. They absolutely loved what they saw, but when they found out approximately how much money I made, or that I drive a Honda Civic, or that I only have an apartment and don't own my own home, the body language immediately showed disinterest and then they would attempt to friend zone me or make me an orbiter.

I feel like nothing I do is enough. we're trying to find them a therapist, but anyone who has one knows what a hassle it is to find the right one. It takes time. I don't want to burn myself out trying to help them. It's also difficult not to take it personally when they say things like nothing makes them happy or they haven't been happy in years when we started dating within that time. I know they don't mean it as anything against me. I don't want to make their struggles about me which is why Im posting here instead of saying it to them. But it's difficult wanting to help and not knowing how. It hurts seeing them feel the way they do. I want them to be happy and I don't know how to make that happen. It's not my job because people have to help themsleves for the most part, but still. I struggle myself at times too, but not as bad."
3876,What it’s like to be alone.,w1e2ev,NoEnd2717,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1e2ev/what_its_like_to_be_alone/,2,depression,False,"I am 21 years old. I make $45,000 dollars a year. I am almost debt free. Im in good physical condition because I work out often.  I will be debt free making $50,000 dollars a year in great physical condition by 22 years old. 

What I struggle with is being alone. I have no one to share my life with. I got out of a four year relationship about a year ago and it left me broken, confused and in a constant state of chaos. Why does my life look so great on the outside but yet I have constant suicidal ideation on the inside? Because Im single? When I’m with others everything seems great. In reality, I’m just prolonging my inevitable loneliness. Everyone tells me “you’ll find the right girl eventually” but eventually feels like an eternity. I’m struggling to make it past the next 30 mins. How can I be ok with eventually? For as long as I can remember my goal has been to have a wife and kids and at every turn I see that goal appear then disappear with every new woman that enters my life. God is telling me to be patient I’m sure. But patience is a virtue I do not have the luxury of exercising. 

How does one accept being alone? How do I find solace in myself. How do I reconcile with the fact that I may be alone for a while. How do I learn to be fine, alone?

Prayers are welcomed. Thanks guys."

I'm at that point.

But besides that fact, I have nothing I truly want to do right now that I can do while...poor. But even if we had all the money in the world, I'm not entirely sure what I would want to do.

3878,I reached out for help and instead got in trouble for having a problem that I could not solve myself. Everything is worse now because I asked for help.,w1ixfz,Stormwolf1O1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1ixfz/i_reached_out_for_help_and_instead_got_in_trouble/,1,depression,False,"I am 24 and have struggled with drug addiction for years, since around 2016. I was in rehab for all of 2019 but since then I've regressed and mental illness has taken over. No one knows how to help me anymore since everything they've tried has failed, and I feel like everyone has given up on me out of frustration.  


I am living at my mother's house again and have been using my drug of choice again for months to combat my depression, since nothing else has helped with it. I tried to use it under the radar and felt that I could not be open about using it with anyone, out of shame and guilt and fear because I was told I would be punished and kicked out on the street by my mother if I was found to be using again.  


Two days ago I was high and tried to walk to the bathroom but my legs gave in while walking there and I fell onto the tile floor and hurt myself badly. Being only 24, and never had my body give out on me like this before, this was a really terrifying experience and I felt like I should try again to seek help for fear that I was running out of opportunities to do so.  


I reached out to my best friend because I felt that I could not tell my mother what happened, but due to my potential injuries from the fall, my friend felt that my mom needed to be told in case I need medical attention. I agreed that my friend could call her and tell her what happened, but instead of receiving help my mom let her anger take over instead and has not even once asked if I'm even okay. I am very upset that she has reacted this way and that reaching out for her help has backfired so badly. Instead of getting help I am being punished for having a problem that I am unable to fix myself. My mom says the only reason I am still in the house now is because I am being exposed to COVID daily by my step father who lives here also and is currently recovering from it.  


I feel like I am unable to rely on anyone anymore for fear of just making everyone angry with me, and I don't know what to even do at this point to try to improve my situation. I am still facing homelessness and now my mental state is even worse than before. I am completely terrified. Any advice would be really appreciated."

I won't bore anyone with the details, but I've always on balance just hated existing. Hated the things I had to do everyday. Hated how people treated me, hated getting up in the morning do get through school and complete all my work, hated feeling terrible longing for the acceptance of others, especially romantically, while being too ugly to be acceptable to other people.

However, there were a few moments of ""You know what, I could do this"", like when I was on a robotics team in high school, designing, fabricating, and testing. It kept my brain out of the mire. It gave me a sense of focus that felt real and rewarding, challenging and thrilling. I genuinely did love it. When I worked on the robot, I felt okay. I looked forward to getting out of bed in the morning to go work on it. I thought if I could structure my life in such a way as to do this every day, for a living, I could pay my bills and find a reason to live.

I went to university to get a degree in mechanical engineering. I wanted to go to a prestigious university, I thought it would give me a sense of self worth. That if I had a degree with the right school name on it then I could prove I was worth something, despite how people had treated me.

I did not get into a good school. I got into an garbage pile safety school in the ass end of nowhere that I did badly at, but I did, after much struggling with my mental health, get my engineering degree.

That was back in 2019. I have not worked a single second doing actual engineering work. A local business hired me, promising real work, but they baited and switched me, had me doing menial labour and then laid me off.

I see nothing left in my life. I've applied to hundreds of jobs but the market has spoken, I'm not wanted as an engineer, or for anything really. Currently I'm unemployed. I do have friends, but they're hundreds of miles away and I can't see them very often, so I only see other people every several months. There's local businesses who're hiring, but nothing in me thinks getting some dead end job that I hate in order to support an existence I also hate, so that I can suffer another fifty or sixty years, makes any sense. 

I kept thinking that if I just get to the next stage, just stick it out, get the degree, get the job, I could escape the misery, but I couldn't, and I can imagine no realistic future at this point where I have anything other than the misery."

I been on this subreddit for about a year now. I have low self esteem, felt suicidal thoughts, loneliness, and currently feel like I'm the ugliest person on Earth. I relate with most posts that I see here. The ones I find the most interesting are the lonely posts. I have read many posts where OP expresses that nobody gives them the time of day, no matter what they do. I just realized that I have the opposite problem. I get a lot of positive attention no matter what I do. I hate attention. Any form of attention immediately makes me very uncomfortable. But I'm always push into the center of attention. It been like this my whole life.

&#x200B;

Like at school I didn't talk to nobody at all. When people talk to me, I ignore them or try to end the conversation as fast as possible. I had no friends and I hated school. But everybody in my grade knew my name and who I was. When I was in 3rd - 4th grade, I had a falling out with my best friend. Everybody in the school knew about it even though I didn't tell anyone. Throughout my school life, I had like 40 people try hard to be my friend. I said no to all of them. I always view myself as an ugly and disgusting person. But people be happy as shit when they see me. They wave at me when they see me in public and I always avoid eye contact because of my insecurities.

&#x200B;

And these weren't random people. Some of the most popular and attractive people in school struggled for my attention. I don't know why. I flake and ignore having conversations with pretty girls, and the next day they are still happy to talk to me. I don't know why this happens to me man. I have a boring personality but people still talk to me. Am I attractive or some shit because other insecure, quiet people in my school don't get the same level of attention I get. I'm very fat too, which makes me more insecure in talking to other people. But, the only good I got from this situation is that if I'm getting this level of attention when I'm obese, I can't imagine the type of attention I'll get when I become skinny. I currently losing weight, so I get to see what happens first hand."

&#x200B;

So I don't like to do this on a subject such as depression and mental health, but today I have worked up to it. I would like to offer you a look into my life with depression and suicide through the form of music. Music was the thing that saved me. I was attempting suicide almost daily and was admitted into a teen psych unit where I found a guitar and peace within this. Since then (2018-2019) I have progressed and made original music, mainly focusing around how I used to feel. My music consists of real emotion and some of the lyrics are taken straight out of my suicide letters or poems and journal entries from back then. 

One of my most recent releases was on youtube in the form of a video (link to video: [https://youtu.be/ZHtG3lxCgqk](https://youtu.be/ZHtG3lxCgqk)). I chose to do a video as I feel like this is more likely to display the raw emotion. I have never spoken to anyone about how traumatizing and hurt life was before and during the psych unit. This song is my speaking to it. To my mum. My partner. My dad. This is me being as real as I can be.

I hope you like it if you choose to listen, but I hope you haven't been in a similar situation as I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I am always here for a chat and if you do find some peace and sense of whatever in my music then please consider liking and listening out for more stuff.

I will watch more though cause the feeling of it kind of relates of what I've been dealing and I like how I understand the feeling, the meaning, and more of the movie itself. I like how I think or imagine the thoughts running through my head after I watched the certain movie. Anyways, got any movie suggestions? Thank you in advance."

3910,"I self sabotage relationships and friendships. Probably mainly because I'm not really in a good place for either mentally but I just miss sex, intimacy and belonging. It's a vicious cycle and is a reason why my relationships don't last.

3911,"It can’t get worse, right?🥺",w1frw2,throwaway67890216,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1frw2/it_cant_get_worse_right/,1,depression,False,I thought my life couldn’t get worse. I left a toxic friendship and I thought my life was finally getting back on track. I was feeling happier and motivated again but that’s gone  now. My dog’s health is doing bad and it’s going be soon that we have to put him down. Then my grandma’s health is getting bad. She can’t smell or hear well anymore. She burnt food in her oven and couldn’t even smell it. She can’t even hear the fire alarm going off in her home. Her memory is getting worse each day (dementia runs in her family) but she won’t get help for it. My mental health isn’t doing good because of trauma I have because of my ex friend. My friend Kait is helping to brighten my day up and I appreciate that. I just keep blaming myself for what happened but Kait keeps reminding me that it’s not my fault. I have to remember that it’s not my fault for not seeing the red flags. Some people are good at hiding their true self. I’m hoping nothing gets worse in my life but I don’t know anymore. I feel like life in general is bad for everyone. It seems like for a lot of people nothing will get better.  I thought getting older was a blessing but it’s not. I was more happy and carefree as a kid. Wish I was that way still.

I go back and think of all the times in the past when I thought of killing myself and didn’t do it…and the reason I didn’t want because I thought that the future would hold something for me. And now I’m there, I’m in the future that I was looking towards and I realize…there’s really no reason for me not to have just ended it years ago. My kids are really the only reason, I’ve gotten a little more time with them to make memories for them but…other than that the struggles I had then are the same struggles I have now. I pray and hope and work and put in effort…and it seems like the more I pray about it the worse it gets. The more positive I choose to be, the more negative responses I get. It’s just…it’s no point the struggle doesn’t get you anywhere. You don’t get rewarded for the hard work you put in, there’s no help or compensation for doing the right thing. Perseverance gets you nowhere. It’s pointless. There’s no reason to go on except for just to enjoy the day to day for a little while longer."
3913,Do side effects from antidepressants continue after you stop taking them?,w1fgjm,xdesiraealexis,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w1fgjm/do_side_effects_from_antidepressants_continue/,1,depression,False,"So I was on cymbalta for 14 days, I stopped taking it because the panic attacks were too much. I didn’t take anything for 3 days after I stopped the cymbalta. The panic and side effects continued but it wasn’t nearly as bad. Now I’m on day 2 of prozac. Today is the first day I haven’t had a panic attack (yet) I was able to drive for the first time in weeks. I know they say it gets worse before it gets better. Is it possible that I might avoid the bad side effects with prozac since I pretty much just switched the kind of antidepressant I was on?"
3914,tired of being tired,w13tzt,Lynniepooh1995,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w13tzt/tired_of_being_tired/,6,depression,False,I've struggled with depression my entire life. I've recently hit the worst bottom ever. Some days I can't even get out of bed. I have 2 beautiful children and I cant even bring myself out of this for them. It's effecting my whole family. My partner of 5 years doesn't even look at me the same anymore. I feel like no one loves me. Every time my family talks about me all they say are negative things. It pushes me further into my depression. I'm not sure what to do anymore. Knowing this is hurting my family makes me hate myself. It just makes me feel worse inside. I've tried therapy and medication my whole life. It seems like I don't get anywhere with it. Having to change therapists all the time or change meds only seems to make it worse. What can I do at this point? I try not to think about suicide but at this point it's always on my mind. 😭 please help with words of advice 🙏🏻
3915,I’m not depressed,w131oh,pomanE,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/w131oh/im_not_depressed/,7,depression,False,"I’m not depressed. I have been depressed before, or more like anxiety, and it was painful. I could feel the life force drain out of me and my heart would ache constantly. that mostly stemmed from guilt of not reaching my potential or using my talents. That slowly subsided when I started to pursue my hobbies and to hone my craft.

but now, I see that I have no meaning, I am alone. There is no “special someone” in my life, no one to relate to, there never was a hint. There is nothing to work towards. God has abandoned me. All efforts at self improvement are in vain, these were empty efforts and a self deception to create a meaning when I have no energy left. I never did. All efforts are hot air. I am simply waiting to die. Am I afraid of hell? There is nothing I can do to effect the outcome.

my life is comfortable and free of pain. Friends and family are good to me, I feel bad for people in worse situations than me. I am not suicidal, but I don’t care about my stupid life or aspirations. I look foreword to death for the time being ."
